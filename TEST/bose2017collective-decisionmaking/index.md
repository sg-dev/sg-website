abstract: Collective decision-making is the subfield of collective behaviour concerned
  with how groups reach decisions. Almost all aspects of behaviour can be considered
  in a decision-making context, but here we focus primarily on how groups should optimally
  reach consensus, what criteria decision-makers should optimise, and how individuals
  and groups should forage to optimise their nutrition. We argue for deep parallels
  between understanding decisions made by individuals and by groups, such as the decision-guiding
  principle of value-sensitivity. We also review relevant theory and empirical development
  for the study of collective decision making, including the use of robots.
