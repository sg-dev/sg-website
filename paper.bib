  abstract =	 {Systems design utilizes top-down and bottom-up approaches to influence social or
                  economic systems such that a desired outcome is obtained.  We characterize
                  different approaches, such as network controllability, network interventions,
                  nudging and mechanism design, and discuss the problems involved.  We argue that
                  systems design cannot be reduced to solving complex optimization problems. }
