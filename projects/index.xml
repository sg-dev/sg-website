These positions allow for detailed analysis on how political alliances are formed and leveraged to influence the decision-making process in their favour. Over the years the discipline has generated and adapted different methods and measures to estimate ideological positions of political actors. These measures are based on a variety of data sources, such as roll-call voting behavior in parliament, surveys, social media behavior or campaign contributions of MPs.</description></item></channel></rss>
