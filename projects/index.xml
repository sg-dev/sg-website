This can be achieved in a bottom-up or a top-down manner or a combination of both.
In our models, we use different approaches, such as network controllability and network interventions, nudging and mechanism design. Our publications demonstrate: It works!</description></item><item><title>Resilience</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/projects/resilience/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/projects/resilience/</guid><description>The study of the resilience of complex systems is one of the projects at the core of our group. Our works span theoretical investigations about how to define, quantify, and study resilience, and applied analysis of real world systems. We are particularly interested in the study of social organisations ranging from Online Software Developers communities, to large collaboration networks of firms.

We have developed a broad range of methods for reconstructing such networks from data (finance, credit, risk), novel measures for quantifying network relations (control, ownership, exposure) and agent based and network models for the dynamics of these networks.

Firms collaborate bilaterally or in small groups to exchange knowledge, this way increasing their knowledge stock. Because most firms are engaged in several collaborations at the same time, a large network emerges. It evolves over time, because firms can leave the network if their costs exceed their benefits, new firms can enter, collaborations are terminated and new collaborations are established.</description></item><item><title>Data Science</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/projects/data-science/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/projects/data-science/</guid><description>In our research, we address various issues pertaining to the broader topic of data science. We are particularly interested in the development of methods for the study of large relational datasets, complex systems analysis, and collections of time-stamped interactions from various disciplines.
The methods highlighted here range from network science tools, data scraping and inference, and disambiguation.</description></item><item><title>130 Years of Swiss Parliament</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/projects/130-years-of-swiss-parliament/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/projects/130-years-of-swiss-parliament/</guid><description>We are currently working on two funded research projects surrounding the Swiss Parliament. The first project is a collaboration with the Swiss Data Science Center to build a searchable database of the Swiss Parliament. The second project is an SNF-funded project that examines how members of parliament have shaped the Swiss political landscape throughout the past 130 years.

As different systems and different scientific questions require different approaches to be answered, we constantly develop network based methods to suit our needs.

Examples include the location of firms in cities, the worldwide R&amp;amp;D collaborations of firms, the concentration of foreign direct investments in particular regions, or the competition of production centers.</description></item></channel></rss>
