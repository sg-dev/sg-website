In a follow-up blogpost we explain how we separate and label the different entities with the use of a newly developed software application (designed by the SDSC and our chair).
As a reminder, the records of the Swiss parliament are documented in three different types of documents (see our blogpost on this here).</description></item><item><title>Amtliches Bulletin: records of speeches, amendments and votes -- Part 1</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_6-nrdocuments/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_6-nrdocuments/</guid><description>In this blogpost we give an overview over the information contained in the Amtliches Bulletin&amp;mdash;our second main source of data.
As a reminder, the records of the Swiss parliament are documented in three different types of documents (see our blogpost on this here). While the summary documents contain an overview over all discussed bills (described in detail here (Part 1) and here (Part 2)), the Amtliches Bulletin is our main source for parliamentary speeches and votes.</description></item><item><title>Why Online does not Equal Offline: Comparing Online and Real-World Political Support Among Politicians.</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/brandenberger2021_onlineoffline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/brandenberger2021_onlineoffline/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Summary Documents and the Secrets they Hold -- Part 2</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_5-summarydocs_part2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_5-summarydocs_part2/</guid><description>Summary documents are one of our main sources for the Project 130 Years of Swiss Parliament. As highlighted in Part 1 of our series on Summary Documents, we extract a lot of information from these documents. Most importantly, these documents are our baseline for the complete list of bills presented to parliament. They also include information about cosponsorship signatures, which can be used to study legislative collaborations and alliances.
In this blogpost we talk about the numbering of bills as well as presenting some exceptions that caused us some headaches when exporting and structuring their information.</description></item><item><title>Summary Documents and the Secrets they Hold -- Part 1</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_4-summarydocs_part1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_4-summarydocs_part1/</guid><description>One of our main data sources for our Project 130 Years of Swiss Parliament (click here for the project overview) are so-called summary of proceedings documents. The Amtliches Bulltin publishes summary documents (dt. Übersicht der Verhandlungen or summary of proceedings) for each parliamentary session. These documents contain a list of proposed bills by the members of parliament along with additional information (date of submission, bill text, committee assignments, co-sponsorship, and dates of important decisions).</description></item><item><title>A new data source: Records of the Swiss Parliament</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_3-datasources/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_3-datasources/</guid><description>Our DemocraSci project builds on three data sources.
The Amtliches Bulletin, containing word protocols/proceedings from both chambers Summary of Proceedings, containing an overview over all discussed/submitted bills (dt. Geschäfte) Additional Protocols, containing additional word protocols from sessions recorded between 1921 and 1970. The documentation of the Swiss parliamentary sessions are recorded in the Amtliches Bulletin. These documentations of the sessions have undergone three mayor changes since the foundation of the Swiss Federal Assembly in 1848.</description></item><item><title>Co-Sponsorship Networks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_2-snf-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_2-snf-project/</guid><description>Starting in 2019, we were granted an SNF-research project to study how members of the Swiss parliament shaped the Swiss political landscape.
Project details
funding agency: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) duration: 36 months (2019-2022) Project summary
Analyses of legislative behavior is often based on ideological positions (or policy preferences) of the involved actors, such as parties or individual members of parliament (MPs). These positions allow for detailed analysis on how political alliances are formed and leveraged to influence the decision-making process in their favour.</description></item><item><title>SDSC Project: DemocraSci</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_1-sdsc-project/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_1-sdsc-project/</guid><description>The goal of our research and data project DemocraSci is to create a searchable database of the Swiss Parliament. For the past 130 years (starting in 1891), the Swiss Parliament has carefully documented its actions and debates in the so-called Amtliches Bulletin&amp;mdash;a stenographic record of parliamentary speeches and legislative proposals. In our project we carefully extract and structure the data from the Amtliches Bulletin.
Our database will contain
all bills, legislative proposals and parliamentary questions brought forth by members of the parliament, comittees, parliamentary groups (called Fraktionen) and cantons (in the form of a Standesinitative) all speeches recorded in the Amtliches Bulletin all members passing through the parliament as well as their functions, their committee memberships and their involvement in parliamentary affairs all votes and voting outcomes for proposals all cosponsorship signatures from members of parliament on bills The project is a collaboration between our chair and the Swiss Data Science Center, SDSC.</description></item></channel></rss>
