The Amtliches Bulletin, containing word protocols/proceedings from both chambers Summary of Proceedings, containing an overview over all discussed/submitted bills (dt. Gesch√§fte) Additional Protocols, containing additional word protocols from sessions recorded between 1921 and 1970. The documentation of the Swiss parliamentary sessions are recorded in the Amtliches Bulletin. These documentations of the sessions have undergone three mayor changes since the foundation of the Swiss Federal Assembly in 1848.</description></item><item><title>Co-Sponsorship Networks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2021/03/co-sponsorship-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2021/03/co-sponsorship-networks/</guid><description>Starting in 2019, we were granted an SNF-research project to study how members of the Swiss parliament shaped the Swiss political landscape.
Project details
funding agency: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) duration: 36 months (2019-2022) Project summary
Analyses of legislative behavior is often based on ideological positions (or policy preferences) of the involved actors, such as parties or individual members of parliament (MPs). These positions allow for detailed analysis on how political alliances are formed and leveraged to influence the decision-making process in their favour.</description></item><item><title>SDSC Project: DemocraSci</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2021/03/sdsc-project-democrasci/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2021/03/sdsc-project-democrasci/</guid><description>The goal of our research and data project DemocraSci is to create a searchable database of the Swiss Parliament. For the past 130 years (starting in 1891), the Swiss Parliament has carefully documented its actions and debates in the so-called Amtliches Bulletin&amp;mdash;a stenographic record of parliamentary speeches and legislative proposals. In our project we carefully extract and structure the data from the Amtliches Bulletin.
Our database will contain
all bills, legislative proposals and parliamentary questions brought forth by members of the parliament, comittees, parliamentary groups (called Fraktionen) and cantons (in the form of a Standesinitative) all speeches recorded in the Amtliches Bulletin all members passing through the parliament as well as their functions, their committee memberships and their involvement in parliamentary affairs all votes and voting outcomes for proposals all cosponsorship signatures from members of parliament on bills The project is a collaboration between our chair and the Swiss Data Science Center, SDSC.</description></item></channel></rss>
