&lt;p>As part of &lt;a href="https://www.sg.ethz.ch/projects/signed-relations">this project&lt;/a>, Dr. Giacomo Vaccario and Dr. Piotr GÃ³rski are organizing a workshop satellite at CCS 2022, which takes place online and onsite in Palma de Mallorca.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>According to the structural balance theory, interacting systems balance the positive and negative relations between different system elements such that local conflicts are minimized. Hence, structural imbalances induce a dynamics to resolve such conflicts. This dynamics plays a vital role in evolutionary processes because many very different final states can be reached. When the resolution of one local conflict leads to the formation of another one, metastable states can emerge, and complete balance is out of reach. When complete balance is instead attained, either state with full consensus (paradise state) or two coexisting enemy groups (polarization) crystallize.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Group relations, resilience and the I Ching</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2022/schweitzer2022group-relations-resilience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 04:21:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2022/schweitzer2022group-relations-resilience/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
