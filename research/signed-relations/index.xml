About the Satellite According to the structural balance theory, interacting systems balance the positive and negative relations between different system elements such that local conflicts are minimized. Hence, structural imbalances induce a dynamics to resolve such conflicts. This dynamics plays a vital role in evolutionary processes because many very different final states can be reached.</description></item><item><title>Group relations, resilience and the I Ching</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2022/schweitzer2022group-relations-resilience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2022/schweitzer2022group-relations-resilience/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
