Our aim is to enhance the reliability of pharmaceutical distribution, ensuring medicines remain accessible during disruptions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Signed Relations and Structural Balance in Complex Systems: From Data to Models</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/signed-relations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/signed-relations/</guid><description>&lt;p>According to the theory of structural balance, interacting systems balance the (positive or negative) relations between
different system elements such that local conflicts are minimized.
Hence, structural imbalances induce a dynamics to resolve such conflicts.
This dynamics plays a vital role in evolutionary processes because a multitude of possible solutions exists.
At the same time, if these solutions cannot be reached, this can hamper the functionality of systems.
This general problem also occurs in social systems, where instead of a more balanced state, for instance, the polarization of opinions emerges.
Are we able to address this problem from a formal perspective?
Do we have data available to study it in real systems?
Can we develop models that help us to understand when structural balance fails, and how it can be mitigated?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resilience</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/resilience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/resilience/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Resilience&lt;/strong> denotes the capacity of a system to &lt;strong>withstand shocks&lt;/strong> and the ability to &lt;strong>recover&lt;/strong> from them.
Hence, it combines two different concepts:
&lt;strong>Robustness&lt;/strong> captures the &lt;strong>structural&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>adaptivity&lt;/strong> the &lt;strong>dynamic&lt;/strong> dimension of resilience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conversely, resilience cannot be reduced to notions of &lt;strong>robustness&lt;/strong> or stability.
Rigid systems in engineering or society can be quite robust against shocks, but once they fail, they never recover.
Resilience addresses the &lt;strong>recovery&lt;/strong>, i.e. the response after shock.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social software engineering</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/software-engineering/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/software-engineering/</guid><description>&lt;p>Social software engineering allows us to study the structure
and dynamics of &lt;strong>socio-technical systems&lt;/strong>. On the one
hand, we can extract the social structure of software developer
teams, i.e., the &lt;strong>producers&lt;/strong>, on the other hand we can
analyse the
structure of the software code, i.e., the &lt;strong>product&lt;/strong>.
Hence, we can address the relation
between &lt;strong>collaboration&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>productivity&lt;/strong> using very
fine-grained data resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="structure-and-dynamics-of-software-systems">Structure and dynamics of software systems&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Typical modern software systems consist of hundreds or even thousands of interdependent modules or subsystems, which are working together in complex ways and which mutually depend on each others&amp;rsquo; functionality. A proper understanding of the structure of such software systems, as well as of the evolution of these structures as their development progresses is fundamental for the design and management of secure, reliable and maintainable software. Naturally, such systems can be studied from a complex networks perspective, where functions, classes, or packages are represented by nodes and the interdependencies between them are modeled as links.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Collective dynamics of opinions and emotions</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/opinions-emotions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 18:33:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/opinions-emotions/</guid><description>&lt;p>The emergence of consensus in groups with diverse opinions,
or the emergence of collective emotions in online
communities are prime examples for the self-organization in
social systems.
We combine agent-based modeling, experiments with human
subjects, data retrieval and analysis from online social
platforms to understand such processes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Systems interventions</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/systems/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 18:33:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/systems/</guid><description>&lt;p>Systems design denotes an approach to manipulate technical, environmental, social or economic systems such that a desired outcome is obtained.
This can be achieved in a bottom-up or a top-down manner or a combination of both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our models, we use different approaches, such as network controllability and network interventions, nudging and mechanism design. Our publications demonstrate: It works!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>130 Years of Swiss Parliament</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/130-years-of-swiss-parliament/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/130-years-of-swiss-parliament/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are currently working on two funded research projects surrounding the Swiss Parliament.
The first project is a collaboration with the Swiss Data Science Center to build a searchable database of the Swiss Parliament.
The second project is an SNF-funded project that examines how members of parliament have shaped the Swiss political landscape throughout the past 130 years.&lt;/p>

a prime example of large-scale economic networks.
Firms collaborate bilaterally or in small groups to exchange knowledge, this way increasing their knowledge stock.
Because most firms are engaged in several collaborations at the same time, a large network emerges.
It evolves over time, because
firms can leave the network if their costs exceed their benefits, new firms can enter, collaborations are terminated and new collaborations are established.
What do we find when analyzing 21.000 research alliances between 15.000 firms over 25 years?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Science</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/data-science/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/data-science/</guid><description>&lt;p>In our research, we address various issues pertaining to the broader topic of data science.
We are particularly interested in the development of methods for the study of large relational datasets, complex systems analysis, and collections of time-stamped interactions from various disciplines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The methods highlighted here range from network science tools, data scraping and inference, and disambiguation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reputation, Trust and Cooperation</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/reputation-trust-cooperation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/reputation-trust-cooperation/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Tit for Tat&amp;rdquo;, a strategy in repeated game theoretical
interactions, is a prime example to explain how inherent
attributes of agents, such as cooperation or defection, shape social behavior.
Reputation generates a strong signal for firms and online
users to develop trust in information provided by their
counterparty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Science of Science</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/science-of-science/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/science-of-science/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Social Influence</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/social-influence/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/social-influence/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Network Theory</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/network-theory/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/network-theory/</guid><description>&lt;p>Networks provide an optimal representation for complex systems.

&lt;p>The term &amp;lsquo;systemic risk&amp;rsquo; denotes the risk that a whole
system consisting of many interacting agents fails. We see
systemic risk as a macroscopic property that emerges
from the nonlinear interactions of agents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This differs
from a conventional view that focuses on the probability
of single extreme events, e.g. earthquakes or big meteors
hitting the earth, that seriously damage the system. It
also differs from a perspective, for example, used in
finance, where a single agent is big enough to damage the
whole system - which leads to the notion of systemic
importance.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
