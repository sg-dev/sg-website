Hence, structural imbalances induce a dynamics to resolve such conflicts. This dynamics plays a vital role in evolutionary processes because a multitude of possible solutions exists. At the same time, if these solutions cannot be reached, this can hamper the functionality of systems. This general problem also occurs in social systems, where instead of a more balanced state, for instance, the polarization of opinions emerges.</description></item><item><title>Resilience</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/resilience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/resilience/</guid><description>Resilience denotes the capacity of a system to withstand shocks and the ability to recover from them. Hence, it combines two different concepts: Robustness captures the structural and adaptivity the dynamic dimension of resilience.
Conversely, resilience cannot be reduced to notions of robustness or stability. Rigid systems in engineering or society can be quite robust against shocks, but once they fail, they never recover. Resilience addresses the recovery, i.e. the response after shock.</description></item><item><title>Social software engineering</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/software-engineering/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/software-engineering/</guid><description>Social software engineering allows us to study the structure and dynamics of socio-technical systems. On the one hand, we can extract the social structure of software developer teams, i.e., the producers, on the other hand we can analyse the structure of the software code, i.e., the product. Hence, we can address the relation between collaboration and productivity using very fine-grained data resolution.
Structure and dynamics of software systems Typical modern software systems consist of hundreds or even thousands of interdependent modules or subsystems, which are working together in complex ways and which mutually depend on each others&amp;rsquo; functionality.</description></item><item><title>Collective dynamics of opinions and emotions</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/opinions-emotions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 18:33:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/opinions-emotions/</guid><description>The emergence of consensus in groups with diverse opinions, or the emergence of collective emotions in online communities are prime examples for the self-organization in social systems. We combine agent-based modeling, experiments with human subjects, data retrieval and analysis from online social platforms to understand such processes.</description></item><item><title>Systems interventions</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/systems/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 18:33:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/systems/</guid><description>Systems design denotes an approach to manipulate technical, environmental, social or economic systems such that a desired outcome is obtained. This can be achieved in a bottom-up or a top-down manner or a combination of both.
In our models, we use different approaches, such as network controllability and network interventions, nudging and mechanism design. Our publications demonstrate: It works!</description></item><item><title>130 Years of Swiss Parliament</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/130-years-of-swiss-parliament/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/130-years-of-swiss-parliament/</guid><description>We are currently working on two funded research projects surrounding the Swiss Parliament. The first project is a collaboration with the Swiss Data Science Center to build a searchable database of the Swiss Parliament. The second project is an SNF-funded project that examines how members of parliament have shaped the Swiss political landscape throughout the past 130 years.

We have developed a broad range of methods for reconstructing such networks from data (finance, credit, risk), novel measures for quantifying network relations (control, ownership, exposure) and agent based and network models for the dynamics of these networks.

Firms collaborate bilaterally or in small groups to exchange knowledge, this way increasing their knowledge stock. Because most firms are engaged in several collaborations at the same time, a large network emerges. It evolves over time, because firms can leave the network if their costs exceed their benefits, new firms can enter, collaborations are terminated and new collaborations are established.</description></item><item><title>Data Science</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/data-science/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/data-science/</guid><description>In our research, we address various issues pertaining to the broader topic of data science. We are particularly interested in the development of methods for the study of large relational datasets, complex systems analysis, and collections of time-stamped interactions from various disciplines.
The methods highlighted here range from network science tools, data scraping and inference, and disambiguation.</description></item><item><title>Reputation, Trust and Cooperation</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/reputation-trust-cooperation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/reputation-trust-cooperation/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Tit for Tat&amp;rdquo;, a strategy in repeated game theoretical interactions, is a prime example to explain how inherent attributes of agents, such as cooperation or defection, shape social behavior. Reputation generates a strong signal for firms and online users to develop trust in information provided by their counterparty.</description></item><item><title>Science of Science</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/science-of-science/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/science-of-science/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Network Theory</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/network-theory/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/network-theory/</guid><description>Networks provide an optimal representation for complex systems.

Examples include the location of firms in cities, the worldwide R&amp;amp;D collaborations of firms, the concentration of foreign direct investments in particular regions, or the competition of production centers.</description></item><item><title>Systemic Risks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/systemic-risks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/research/systemic-risks/</guid><description>Modeling systemic risks The term &amp;lsquo;systemic risk&amp;rsquo; denotes the risk that a whole system consisting of many interacting agents fails. We see systemic risk as a macroscopic property that emerges from the nonlinear interactions of agents.
This differs from a conventional view that focuses on the probability of single extreme events, e.g. earthquakes or big meteors hitting the earth, that seriously damage the system. It also differs from a perspective, for example, used in finance, where a single agent is big enough to damage the whole system - which leads to the notion of systemic importance.</description></item></channel></rss>
