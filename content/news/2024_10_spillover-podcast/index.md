<strong>How the Podcast was created</strong>
<br>
The podcast was created using the generative AI model <a href="http://notebooklm.google">NotebookLM</a>. The AI generated a conversation between two fictional podcasters, utilizing the provided materials to craft an in-depth discussion. To make the podcast engaging and natural, the model didn’t simply convert text into audio; it incorporated emphasis, interruptions, and those distinctive “ums” and “huhs” that characterize real conversations.
<br>
We supplied the model with our peer-reviewed journal articles, policy briefs, and research notes. All statements were subsequently fact-checked to ensure accuracy and relevance.
