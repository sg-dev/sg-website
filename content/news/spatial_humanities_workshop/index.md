Ramona Roller presents extraction and use of geo-spatial data on territories of the Holy Roman Empire. These data can be used to analyze the European reformation of the 16th century.

The workshop 'Geography meets Digital Humanities: Neuere Ans√§tze raumbezogener Modellierung' addresses the question of how to use 'space' in scientific analyses in the Digital Humanities. Definitions of 'space' range from interpretative frameworks to geographic notations. Ramona presents a novel data set comprising geo-spatial attributes of territories of the Holy Roman Empire in the 16th century. She shows how she extracted the data from analogue maps and used it to analyse socio-political processes during the Reformation such as confessionalization.
