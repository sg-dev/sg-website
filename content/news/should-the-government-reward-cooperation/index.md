We derive analytical expressions for the critical bonus needed to make cooperation as attractive as defection. We show that for one information regime the critical bonus increases with the level of cooperation, while in a second regime the bonus decreases with the level of cooperation. In this second regime, full cooperation can be achieved once a cold-start problem is solved. See our paper [here](https://www.sg.ethz.ch/media/publication_files/2101.05580.pdf).
