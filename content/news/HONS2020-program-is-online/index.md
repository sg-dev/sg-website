The [program](https://uzhdag.github.io/hons_web/program.html) of our HONS satellite at NetSci 2020 is online [here](https://uzhdag.github.io/hons_web/). It will take place online on September 17, 2020.

HONS is the NetSci satellite for researchers that try to understand what we miss when we analyze graphs and network abstractions of complex systems. Its focus is on cutting-edge Higher-Order Network modelling techniques, which generalize network science techniques to models that account for higher-order dependencies in data on real systems.
