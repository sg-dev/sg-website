Bechstein's bats form groups of different size to spend the **day** together in several roosts. At dusk, these groups dissolve, at dawn they may re-merge. So, what is a typical group size? And how long does a group use the same roost? We answer these questions by analyzing empirical data from two colonies. What is more, we also provide an agent-based model to reproduce these findings. See our paper [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/862219v1).
