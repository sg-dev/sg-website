<br>

To make [our research on drug shortage mitigation and prevention](/projects/pharmaceutical-supply-chain-resilience/) accessible to a broader audience, we created an AI-generated podcast. The podcast discusses our findings on pharmaceutical supply chain resilience (see the [project page](/projects/pharmaceutical-supply-chain-resilience/) for a list of publications).

Additionally, the podcast provides a broad overview of our current research focus: developing a shortage mitigation system for pharmaceutical supply chains called *ARIADNE*. *ARIADNE* delivers real-time insights and actionable strategies to prevent drug shortages and enhance supply chain resilience.

This podcast offers a concise and informative discussion that captures the key themes of our research, from the root causes of pharmaceutical supply chain vulnerabilities to strategies for strengthening resilience.
We hope this AI-generated podcast serves as a convenient and accessible resource for anyone interested in the topic, whether they are policymakers, healthcare professionals, or curious members of the public.

<strong>How the Podcast was created</strong>
<br>
The podcast was created using the generative AI model <a href="http://notebooklm.google">NotebookLM</a>. The AI generated a conversation between two fictional podcasters, utilizing the provided materials to craft an in-depth discussion. To make the podcast engaging and natural, the model didn’t simply convert text into audio; it incorporated emphasis, interruptions, and those distinctive “ums” and “huhs” that characterize real conversations.
<br>
We supplied the model with our peer-reviewed journal articles, policy briefs, and research notes. All statements were subsequently fact-checked to ensure accuracy and relevance.
