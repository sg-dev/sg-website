#### Just published in **Science**: our Letter on the risks of extending U.S. tariffs to pharmaceuticals — *US tariffs jeopardize medicine supply chains.*

We explain how tariffs on low-margin generic drugs could quickly lead to supply shocks, turning essential medicines into a strategic tool of retaliation in trade conflicts — with real consequences for millions of patients.

[Read the Letter!](https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-2679/full) Our full, data-driven policy analysis is forthcoming.
