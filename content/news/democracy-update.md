- add taxonomy for proejcts:
  posts with `project: democrasci` are collected in a Project Page with all posts under it

```python {linenos=table,hl_lines=[8,"15-17"]}

    ("C", "C"): 7,
    ("C", "D"): 0,
    ("D", "D"): 0,
    ("D", "C"): 10,
}

def payoff_gain_if(my_choice, others_choices):
    my_payoff = 0
    for s in others_choices:
        my_payoff += payoff_matrix[(my_choice, s)]

    return my_payoff

def gain_from_switching(my_current_strategy, others_choices):
    payoff_if_c = payoff_gain_if('C', others_choices)
    payoff_if_d = payoff_gain_if('D', others_choices)

    gain_from_d = payoff_if_d - payoff_if_c
    gain_from_c = - gain_from_d

    if my_current_strategy == "C":
