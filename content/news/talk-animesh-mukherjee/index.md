### Abstract

In this talk, I shall be discussing some of the projects that we have been doing in the analysis, detection, and mitigation of hate content in online social media. I shall begin by discussing how hate speech spreads on an unmoderated platform like Gab. Next, I shall discuss specialized detection models for trapping hate speech that is (a) explainable and (b) appropriate in a multilingual setting. Subsequently, I shall talk about mitigation techniques using counterspeech. I shall close by talking about a new form of harmful content â€” fear speech and our ongoing research activities.
