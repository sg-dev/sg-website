The latest version of our R library ghypernet is available on CRAN.

The library allows studying multi-edge networks using the framework of the **generalised hypergeometric ensemble** of random graphs. Install the package by running `install.packages('ghypernet')` in R, or go to [ghyper.net](https://ghyper.net/) for more information.
