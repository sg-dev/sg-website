description: Out now - Special issue on "Succes in Science"
---

We are glad that our special issue on the *Success in Science* is [now available online][1]
In this issue, we collect and present developments in the field of *Science of Science* under a complex system perspective.
The special issue is the result of presentations and discussions at the satellite [*Scientific Networks and Success*][2] at [CCS 2020][3].

This issue and the satellite would not have been possible without the valuable contributions of the authors, speakers and close collaboration of researchers at ETH ZÃ¼rich and the University of California Merced.
Specifically, we thank the Editors and Guest Editors of ACS and Organizers of the CCS satellite.

We hope you enjoy the contributions in this special issue!
