We are glad that our special issue on the *Succes in Science* is [now available online][1]
Here, we collect and present developments in the fields of *Science of Science* under a complex systems perspective.

The special issue is the result of presentations and discussions at the satellite [*Scientific Networks and Success*][2] at [CCS 2020][3].
This issue and the satellite would not have been possible without the valuable contributions by the authors, speakers and close collaboration of researchers at ETH ZÃ¼rich and the University of California Merced.
Specifically the Guest Editors of ACS and Organizers of the CCS satellite.

- [Prof. Alexander M. Petersen](http://physics.bu.edu/~amp17/)

We hope you enjoy the contributions in this special issue!
