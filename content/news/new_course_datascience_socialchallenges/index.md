# Course abstract

Many of today's societal challenges cannot be adequately grasped simply by observing human behavior. To make these challenges visible and address their causes, we have to make use of advanced statistics in order to disentangle complex interdependencies between the driving factors.

In this course, we use methods of statistical inference to measure, analyze and interpret social behavior. The course aims at building up methodological skills and places a strong focus on interpretation and reflection of results.
