## Job description

The student assistant position comprises two roles: teaching and research assistant. As a teaching assistant, the student will help restructure material for the MSc course 'Systems dynamics and complexity' and work together with Prof. Frank Schweitzer, Dr. Giona Casiraghi and Dr. Christian Zingg. The student will create lecture slides in LaTex and prepare Python code for student exercises, which involves solving differential equations of economic models (e.g., Kaldor model) and visualizing their results.

As research assistant, the student will contribute to a project in Computational Social Science which analyses the link between people's social roles and their intentions. The student will extract expressions of intentionality from written texts (modern e-mails and 16 th century letters), such as 'wanting', 'planning' or 'intending', and link them to people's behaviors. This task may involve manual text labeling and the construction of an NLP model. The student will work together with Dr. Ramona Roller.
