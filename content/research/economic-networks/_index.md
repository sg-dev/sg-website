Economic networks are one of our main research topics, for more than 15 years. We have developed a broad range of methods for reconstructing such networks from data (finance, credit, risk), novel measures for quantifying network relations (control, ownership, exposure) and agent based and network models for the dynamics of these networks.

Checkout the respective projects for more details.
