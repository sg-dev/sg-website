Social software engineering allows us to study the structure
and dynamics of **socio-technical systems**. On the one
hand, we can extract the social structure of software developer
teams, i.e., the **producers**, on the other hand we can
analyse the
structure of the software code, i.e., the **product**. 
Hence, we can address the relation 
between  **collaboration** and **productivity** using very
fine-grained data resolution. 

### Structure and dynamics of software systems 


Typical modern software systems consist of hundreds or even thousands of interdependent modules or subsystems, which are working together in complex ways and which mutually depend on each others' functionality. A proper understanding of the structure of such software systems, as well as of the evolution of these structures as their development progresses is fundamental for the design and management of secure, reliable and maintainable software. Naturally, such systems can be studied from a complex networks perspective, where functions, classes, or packages are represented by nodes and the interdependencies between them are modeled as links.


### Collaboration in software developer teams


*Open Source* software is created by self-organized teams of
developers. 
These teams are very dynamic as members join or leave, and
individual productivity varies over time. 
Hence, the collaboration structure, the distribution of  tasks and responsibilities in software development teams will positively or negatively affect the performance of the project.
Analysing large-scale data sets with state-of-the-art
methods from complex networks and machine learning, we can
quantify the coordination effort within teams and their
productivity dependent on team size.
