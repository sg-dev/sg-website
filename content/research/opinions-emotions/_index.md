The emergence of consensus in groups with diverse opinions,
or the emergence of collective emotions in online
communities are prime examples for the self-organization in
social systems. 
We combine agent-based modeling, experiments with human
subjects, data retrieval and analysis from online social
platforms to understand such processes.
