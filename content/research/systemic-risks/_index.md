## Modeling systemic risks
 
 
 The term 'systemic risk' denotes the risk that a whole
 system consisting of many interacting agents fails. We see
 systemic risk as a    macroscopic property that emerges
 from the nonlinear interactions of agents. 
 
 This differs
 from a conventional view that focuses on    the probability
 of single extreme events, e.g. earthquakes or big meteors
 hitting the earth, that seriously damage the system. It
 also    differs from a perspective, for example, used in
 finance, where a single agent is big enough to damage the
 whole system - which leads    to the notion of systemic
 importance. 
 
 In addition to all these ingredients, our
 systemic perspective emphasizes the impact of individual
 failure exerted on other agents. I.e., the systemic failure
 can start with the failure of a few agents which is
 amplified both by    interaction mechanisms and by systemic
 feedback. This can lead to failure cascades which span a
 significant part of the system.        
 
 We provide a general
 framework for modelling systemic risk which was first
 applied to fully connected networks and is being extended
 to networks with arbitrary degree distribution from a
 formal theoretical point of view. Since we also allow for
 nodes to have    heterogeneous robustness, various
 applications and extensions of the existing models are
 possible. They include credit networks,    supply networks
 or social online networks where cascades of leaving users
 may threaten the existence of the platform.        
 
 Our
 approach is based on the concept of complex networks, where
 agents are represented by nodes in a network, whereas their
 interactions are modelled by links between them. Both nodes
 and links can follow their own dynamics and influence each
 other by    feedback effects. In order to understand the
 emergence of systemic risk, we have to model (a) the
 internal dynamics of the agents,    which is largely
 neglected in other approaches, (b) the interaction dynamics
 of the agents (in particular the network topology), (c)
 macroscopic or systemic feedback, i.e. the impact of
 changing external conditions, (d) trend reinforcement,
 i.e. the fact that    interactions are path dependent and
 depend on the history of previous interactions.
