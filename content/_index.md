Welcome to the legacy webpage of the Chair of Systems
Design (2004-2025).

In October 2004, Frank Schweitzer established the Chair of
Systems Design at ETH Zürich, and  our
activities ended because of his retirement on 31 January 2025. 
More information can be found under [Final
Symposium](/events/sg-final-symposium-october-2024/) and in
an [Interview](https://mtec.ethz.ch/news/dmtec-news/2024/12/small-triggers-big-shifts-looking-back-at-20-years-of-systemgestaltung-with-professor-frank-schweitzer.html) on the portal of the [Department of
Management, Technology, and Economics](https://mtec.ethz.ch/). 

Over a period of 20 years, more than 50 researchers from various disciplines
(statistical physics, applied mathematics, computer science,
political science and economics) have been working with us. 
30 of them obtained their doctoral degree.
More information about our collaborators can be found under 
[Team](/team/) and [Theses](/theses/). 

 Our research can be best described as
*data driven modelling* of complex systems with particular
emphasis on social, socio-technical, and socio-economic
systems.
More information can be found under [About us](/about/), [Research](/research/),
[Publications](/publications) and [Projects](projects). 
The publication list will be **regularly updated** as pending
papers are published.  

Frank Schweitzer remains at ETH Zurich as a Professor
emeritus (Prof. em.) and can still be reached via his email
address "@ethz.ch". 
A small team with Dr. Luca Verginer, Dr. Giona Casiraghi
and Dr. Georges Andres will continue at ETH Zürich to work
on 
[pharmaceutical supply chain resilience](/research/pharmaceutical-supply-chain-resilience/).
