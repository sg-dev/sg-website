### Abstract 

Temporal networks are commonly used to represent systems
where connections between elements are active only for
restricted periods of time, such as in telecommunication
systems, biochemical reactions or social networks. Such
time-varying interactions may be biased by local
correlations between causally related events and commonly
influenced by memory effects, which in turn lead to the
emergence of mesoscale temporal motifs, long time-respecting
paths, and bursty interaction dynamics. In these talk we
will address the consequences of memory driven and casually
related interactions on the emerging network structure and
on the outcome of ongoing dynamical processes.
