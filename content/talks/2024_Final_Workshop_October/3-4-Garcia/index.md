### Abstract
 

Our online life generates a vast amount of digital traces,
for example when we use our phone or talk with others on
social media. These traces can be used to study aspects of
emotional life that were very difficult to study with
experiments or surveys. I will present work on the
development and application of digital trace data analysis
to study emotions at various levels. I will present LEIA, a
language model to identify individual emotions from social
media text and how text analysis methods can be applied to
create emotion macroscopes of society at large.
