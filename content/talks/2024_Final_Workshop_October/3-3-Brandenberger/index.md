### Abstract

Are we truly witnessing an era of unprecedented polarization? While many researchers contend that political polarization—particularly among elites—has intensified worldwide, much of the empirical research relies on short-term analyses. This begs the question: could elite polarization have fluctuated throughout history, following a natural ebb and flow?

In this talk, I explore the evolution of ideological polarization within the Swiss National Parliament, spanning from 1891 to the present. By constructing a unified ideological space, we trace party positions over the last 130 years. Our findings suggest that today's polarization levels are historically unmatched.

The data reveals a dramatic increase in polarization within the Swiss Parliament, beginning in the 1970s and accelerating in the 1990s. These shifts align with the rise of the Swiss People's Party and Switzerland's growing engagement with Europe during that same period.
