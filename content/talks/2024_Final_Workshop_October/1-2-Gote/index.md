### Abstract

How can we predict and optimise the performance of software development teams? This talk addresses this question by leveraging insights from network science to explore the complex interplay between the technical and social structures of software projects. Looking back on the past 20 years at the Chair of Systems Design, we delve into how changes in project structure and team dynamics impact collaboration and success. By studying both open-source and proprietary software development, we examine how growth, developer turnover, and interactions shape both the technical evolution of software and the social fabric of the teams behind it. The analysis reveals patterns that can help enhance team resilience and productivity, ensuring sustainable development in diverse software ecosystems. By the end of this presentation, youâ€™ll gain a deeper understanding of how to utilise network analysis to predict key outcomes in software development and optimise collaboration for success.
