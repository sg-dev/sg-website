### Abstract

Models and mechanisms for the dynamics of opinion dynamics
are an intriguing topic where complex systems research wants
to contribute to our understanding of the phenomenon of
polarization. A problem is that social processes and in
particular opinion dynamics in the real world do not unfold
in isolation, also other factors than just local interaction
about opinions determine the opinions of individuals. In the
talk I will present opinion distributions from movie ratings
and attitude surveys and showcase some directions for a
complementary more data-driven modeling approach.
