### Abstract

This talk explores the multifaceted nature of code review in software development, delving into its three core dimensions: technical, social, and cognitive. While commonly perceived as a straightforward process aimed at bug detection, the talk will show how code review plays a broader role, significantly impacting knowledge transfer, team dynamics, and shared code ownership. In addressing the triadic nature of code review, we will discuss its evolution from a tool for code inspection to a critical element of social software engineering. This talk will present highlights from ten years of investigations on code review, with the goal of informing evidence-based code review tools and practices.
