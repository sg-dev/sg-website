### Abstract

Open source software repositories offer high resolution data about the collaboration of developers. These data are not only of interest for software engineering, they also benefit management and organization science. Thanks to the open source Python package git2net
we are able to extract co-editing networks from git repositories. Combining network measures with fine grained analyses of code changes, we are able to quantify the productivity of developers, their coordination effort, and the resilience of OSS projects against the drop-out of core developers.
