### Abstract

This presentation delves into the rich landscape of signed
networks, approaching the intricate positive and negative
relationships that shape social dynamics, including
phenomena like polarization and evolving social
ties. Offering a dual perspective on theory and dynamics,
the first part of the talk will focus on the theoretical
complexities of polarization, introducing the "Multiscale
Semiwalk Balance" approach. This methodology addresses
computational challenges, providing scalable insights into
balance degrees within real-world social systems. Shifting
the lens, the second part of the talk will discuss
navigating through the dynamics of high school social
relations, investigating the interplay of Structural Balance
(SB) and stochastic mechanisms. A continuous time model,
integrating cognitive constraints, is presented to
faithfully replicate observed network dynamics. This talk
bridges theoretical nuances and practical applications,
shedding light on key aspects of signed networks and their
implications for social relations.
