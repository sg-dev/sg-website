### Abstract

We all agree that social media has changed the way political
information spreads across the internet, but there is
paucity of research on how exactly this new way of spreading
works. In this talk, we will start by discussing the new
patterns of data flow and new roles for users in spreading
information and this new model coexists with remnants of the
classic two-level propagation. Then, using the polarization
model inspired by the Ising model, we discuss how the
presence of social media increases polarization. Political
scientists have documented increasing partisan division,
finding extremist positions to be more pronounced among
political elites than among voters, raising the question of
how polarization might be attenuated. 

In this talk, we
introduce a general model of opinion change to see if the
self-reinforcing dynamics of influence and homophily may
enable tipping points that make reversibility
problematic. We also introduced exogenous shocks
corresponding to events that create a shared interest
against a common threat (e.g., a global pandemic). Phase
diagrams of political polarization reveal
difficult-to-predict transitions that can be irreversible
due to asymmetric hysteresis trajectories. We focus on
social media, which has been transforming political
communication dynamics for over a decade. Using a billion
tweets, we analyzed the change in Twitter’s news media
landscape between the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Presidential
elections. We then identify influencers, users with the top
ability to spread news in the Twitter network. The more
influential 2016 users were, the higher was their rate of
remaining active and keeping their level of influence
in 2020. We also analyze changes in influencers’ real-world
affiliations, political biases, and in Twitter users’
choices as to which influencers to retweet and which
ideology to subsequently support. We also compare 2020
Twitter dynamic and compare it to Parler dynamic in the same
period. We observe that the initial polarization tends to be
stable.
