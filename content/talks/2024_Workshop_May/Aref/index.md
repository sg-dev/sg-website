### Abstract

A signed network is one with positive and negative edges. We
analyze signed networks from the perspective of balance
theory. A signed network is strongly balanced (weakly
balanced) if its nodes can be partitioned into kâ‰¤2 clusters
(k clusters) such that positive edges are within the
clusters and negative edges are between the clusters. We use
mathematical programming models to optimally cluster the
nodes of a network by minimizing the total number of
intra-cluster negative and inter-cluster positive edges. 

These optimization models cluster a network into clusters of
nodes that are internally cohesive and mutually
divisive. The optimal partitions of a network allow us to
quantify the extent to which it is weakly or strongly
balanced. In other words, we measure the distance of a
network to weak and strong balance in terms of the minimum
number of edges whose sign change leads to weak and strong
balance respectively. 

The concepts of strong and weak balance in signed networks can be extended to applications beyond the classic friend-enemy interpretation of balance theory in the social context. Through extensive computational analysis, we explore common structural patterns across a range of networks representing philosophers and Wikipedia editors to Bitcoin traders and US Congress legislators. This talk provides an overview of using integer programming to develop exact graph optimization models and algorithms for signed networks. A wide range of use cases will be discussed for signed networks from sociology, biology, chemistry and physics to finance, international relations, and political science.
