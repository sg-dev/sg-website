### Abstract
 
We introduce an agent-based model integrating structural
balance and status, which are prominent theories of signed
link formation process. For complete networks, our analytics
matches simulations showing continuous or discontinuous
phase transition between unbalanced and structurally
balanced paradise states. We identify nonhierarchical triads
for which principles of status theory are broken. 

Extending
our analysis to large online and small face-to-face
networks, we observe that nonhierarchical triads tend to be
under-represented. We reproduce these deviations in our
simulations by adjusting, among others, the parameter
related to the competition between balance and
status. Relating obtained levels of competition with the
face-to-face dataset's characteristics revealed that
networks with a higher prevalence of strong relations favor
balance, while those with a greater prosociality of agents
exhibit higher under-representations, indicating the larger
influence of status theory.
