### Abstract

I will present [Quotebank](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/Quotebank), a publicly available, Web-scale corpus of 178 million speaker-attributed quotations extracted from 196 million English news articles published between August 2008 and April 2020. After introducing the dataset, I will highlight several studies in which Quotebank was used to study the U.S. political landscape, showing, e.g., that negativity among U.S. politicians has increased, and that the objectivity of U.S. news has decreased, in recent years. In addition to showcasing our own research, I hope the talk will inspire further applications of Quotebank for computational social science.
