### Abstract

In my talk, I will discuss two recent papers that draw causal conclusions on the effectiveness of content moderation from observational data. First, I will present results from a fuzzy regression discontinuity design analyzing the effect of automated content moderation on Facebook. Exploiting the arbitrary machine-learning thresholds used by Facebook's moderation system, I will show how automated content moderation reduces subsequent rule-breaking behavior. Second, I will present the results of a difference-in-differences design studying the impact of deplatforming Parler (following the Jan 6 capitol attack) on the consumption of fringe content online. Using real user navigation logs, we show that deplatforming Parler did not decrease overall consumption of fringe social media, as users promptly flocked to other websites offering similar content (e.g., Rumble, Gab). Overall, this talk will showcase that applied causal inference can rigorously inform best content moderation practices.
