### Abstract

Over the past few decades, software development has transitioned from a predominantly solo activity where developers create small stand alone programs, to a widespread distributed activity where hundreds and even thousands of developers operate within an online participatory community of practice to create complex software ecosystems.  This large scale distributed development effort has been made possible by innovations that include the Internet, the World Wide Web, sophisticated development tools and agents, and rich communication channels and social media. In this talk, I will first review the rise of the social developer and describe how today's developers learn from and contribute to this network of knowledge.  The vast online resources that developers have created, often implicitly,  are now being used to fuel the next wave of artificial agents, that are already showing major disruptions in how developers individually and together create software. I will conclude this presentation with a guided discussion around how these changes may impact software development practices in the near and distant future.
