### Abstract

The Russian military aggression against Ukraine in February 2022 showed how illusory our confidence in the stability of the world political system was. 
This belief was mainly due to the short timescale of our observations and our naive expectations that political structures and social relationships around us were fixed points in history's evolution. 
In fact, there is no reason to assume that the known to us socio-political order is the only possible quasi-permanent condition. 
During the seminar, I will demonstrate several agent-based models where changes in socio-political structures have a discontinuous character, especially when collective dynamics of social groups depends not only on deterministic interactions between group members but also on a social noise coming from communication disturbances or complexity of our beliefs. 
These discontinuous changes follow from the multistability of considered systems, and I will visualize them using computer simulations.
