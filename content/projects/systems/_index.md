Systems design denotes an approach to manipulate technical, environmental, social or economic systems such that a desired outcome is obtained.
This can be achieved in a bottom-up or a top-down manner or a combination of both.

In our models, we use different approaches, such as network controllability and network interventions, nudging and mechanism design. Our publications demonstrate: It works!
