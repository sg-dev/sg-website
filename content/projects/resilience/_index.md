_Resilience_ denotes the capacity of a system to _withstand shocks_ and the ability to _recover_ from them.

What does this mean for social systems that are very volatile in their dynamics, for example organizations, collectives or project teams? Differently from engineered or ecological systems, a resilient reference state cannot be defined because individuals join or leave and social relations change quickly.

To model such systems, we combine agent-based modeling and multi-layer network approaches. They allow to quantify the impact of agents and their relations, using collaboration and communication data. Based on these information, we model the robustness and the adaptivity of social systems and propose a novel resilience measure combining these two dimensions.
