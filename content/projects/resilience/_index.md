The study of the resilience of complex systems is one of the projects at the core of our group.
Our works span theoretical investigations about how to define, quantify, and study resilience, and applied analysis of real world systems.
We are particularly interested in the study of social organisations ranging from Online Software Developers communities, to large collaboration networks of firms.

Check back here regularly, for updates on the project, insights into how we extract the data and our most recent findings.
