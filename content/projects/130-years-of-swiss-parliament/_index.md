We are currently working on two funded research projects surrounding the Swiss Parliament.
The first project is a collaboration with the Swiss Data Science Center to build a searchable database of the Swiss Parliament.
The second project is an SNF-funded project that examines how members of parliament have shaped the Swiss political landscape throughout the past 130 years.

Check back here regularly, for updates on the projects, insights into how we extract the data and our most recent findings.
