  abstract =	 {Economics and the social sciences are, in fact, the "hard" sciences, as Herbert
                  Simon argued, because the complexity of the problems dealt with cannot simply be
                  reduced to analytically solvable models or decomposed into separate
                  subprocesses. Nevertheless, in recent years, the emerging interdisciplinary
                  "sciences of complexity" have provided new methods and tools for tackling these
                  problems, ranging from complex data analysis to sophisticated computer
                  simulations. In particular, advanced methods developed in the natural sciences
                  have recently also been applied to social and economic problems.  The twenty-one
                  chapters of this book reflect this modern development from various modeling
                  perspectives (such as agent-based models, evolutionary game theory, reinforcement
                  learning and neural network techniques, time series analysis, non- equilibrium
                  macroscopic dynamics) and for a broad range of socio-economic applications (market
                  dynamics, technological evolution, spatial dynamics and economic growth, decision
                  processes, and agent societies). They jointly demonstrate a shift of perspective
                  in economics and the social sciences that is allowing a new outlook in this field
                  to emerge. }
