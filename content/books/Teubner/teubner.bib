  abstract	= {Phase transitions between different states of matter occur
		  in many equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. The
		  kinetics of these phase changes are studied mainly in the
		  case of condensation of a vapour in a supersaturated state
		  via homogeneous nucleation. Based on thermodynamic
		  investigations of heterogeneous systems, the stochastic and
		  deterministic theory of nucleation and growth of the new
		  phase is derived. Emphasis is put on finite-size-effects
		  which lead to a depletion of the vapour. The results are
		  mainly explained in terms of clusters (droplet model) and
		  extended to the influence of external fields. Numerous
		  computer simulations are presented.},
