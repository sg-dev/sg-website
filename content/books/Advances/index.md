**From the preface by Stefan Thurner and Luís M. A. Bettencourt:**

*“All four parts start with an overview of the topical areas. These insightful introductions make the book more accessible to non-experts, a fact that should help to spread recent developments in complexity science also to a younger audience and scientists outside the field. Experts will enjoy (re-)reading the contributions of a selected crowd of renown complexity scientists. Finally, the book takes an explicit focus on a number of concrete applications in different scientific areas, which makes it particularly attractive."*
