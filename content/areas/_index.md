Our research focuses on the structure and dynamics of complex **social and economic systems**, comprised of a large number of interacting agents.
Our methodological approach can be best described as **data-driven modeling**.
I.e. we analyze big data to detect statistical regularities in such systems.

- We build large-scale agent based models to simulate the interaction dynamics on the "micro" level, to obtain the system's dynamics on the "macro" level.
- We further use rigorous mathematical models to understand such systems.
- We have achieved our goal if the agent-based model, after being calibrated against real data, produces a macro dynamics that not only resembles, but matches the observed dynamics at the system's level.

Such a level of understanding, although hard to achieve, allows us to target the problem of systems design, as we see it: what mechanisms do we have to change on the agent's level, to obtain a more desirable outcome on the system's level: more reliability, more cooperation, better dissemination of information, faster adaptivity of a system to exogeneous and endogeneous changes.
