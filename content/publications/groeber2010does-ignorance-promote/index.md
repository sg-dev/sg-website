abstract: 'A large extent of undetected norm violations may have positive effects
  for society. If many norm violations are hidden, society seems to be in good order
  so that actors are more willing to comply with the norms themselves. In this sense,
  igno-rance promotes norm compliance.We challenge this view by arguing that in scenar-ios,
  in which norms are controlled and enforced by third parties who receive rewards
  for their success, the opposite is true: Ignorance promotes norm violations. The
  rea-son is that unsuspicious inspectors who believe that little hidden norm violations
  are committed will spend less effort for detection, some formerly detected norm
  viola-tions will go undetected, norm targets will be less deterred from the lower
  detection probability and will commit more norm violations over time. This article
  develops a respective mathematical model and confirms the above described intuition.'
