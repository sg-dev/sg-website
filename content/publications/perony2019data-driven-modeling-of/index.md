abstract: Communal roosting in Bechstein's bat colonies is characterized by the formation
  of several groups that use different day roosts and that regularly dissolve and
  re-merge (fission-fusion dynamics). Analyzing data from two colonies of different
  size over many years, we find that (i) the number of days bats stay in the same
  roost before changing follows an exponential distribution that is independent of
  the colony size, and (ii) the number and size of groups bats formed for roosting
  depend on the size of the colony such that above a critical colony size two to six
  groups of different sizes are formed. To model these two observations, we propose
  an agent-based model in which agents make their decisions about roosts based on
  both random and social influences. For the latter, they copy the roost preference
  of another agent which models the transfer of the respective information. Our model
  is able to reproduce both the distribution of stay length in the same roost and
  the emergence of groups of different sizes dependent on the colony size. Moreover,
  we are able to predict the critical system size at which the formation of different
  groups emerges without global coordination. We further comment on dynamics that
  bridge the roosting decisions on short time scale (less than one day) with the social
  structures observed at long time scales (more than one year).
