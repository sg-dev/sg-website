abstract: 'We analyze data about the micro-blogging site Twitter using sentiment extraction
  techniques. From an information per- spective, Twitter users are involved mostly
  in two processes: information creation and subsequent distribution (tweeting), and
  pure information distribution (retweeting), with pro- nounced preference to the
  first. However a rather substantial fraction of tweets are retweeted. Here, we address
  the role of the sentiment expressed in tweets for their potential after- math. We
  find that although the overall sentiment (polarity) does not influence the probability
  of a tweet to be retweeted, a new measure called emotional divergence does have
  an im- pact. In general, tweets with high emotional diversity have a better chance
  of being retweeted, hence influencing the dis- tribution of information.'
