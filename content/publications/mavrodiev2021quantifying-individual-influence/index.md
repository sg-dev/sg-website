abstract: Leading-following behavior as a way of transferring information about the
  location of resources is widespread in different animal societies. However, it cannot
  always be observed directly.   Here, we develop a general method to infer leading-following
  events from observational data if only the discrete appearance of individuals is
  recorded. Our method further allows to distinguish such events from  local enhancement
  at the resource, such as swarming behavior in case of bats, which is another widespread
  way of transferring information among animals.   To test our methodology, we analyze
  longitudinal data about the roosting behavior of Bechstein's bats from two different
  colonies and different years. The detection of leading-following events allows us,
  in a second step, to construct social networks in which nodes represent individual
  bats and directed and weighted links the leading-following events. We analyze the
  topology of these networks on the level of the colony, to see whether all individuals
  participate in leading-following behavior. Further, based on the leading-following
  network we measure the importance of individuals in this leading-following behavior
  by calculating different centrality measures. We find that individuals can be consistently
  ranked regarding their influence on others. Moreover, we identify a small set of
  individuals that play a central role in leading other bats to roosts. Our methodology
  can be used to understand the leading-following behavior and the individual impact
  of group members on the spread of information in animal groups in general.
