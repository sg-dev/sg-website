abstract: "Two node variables determine the evolution of cascades in random networks:
  \ a node's degree and threshold. Correlations between both fundamentally change\
  \ the robustness of a network, yet, they are disregarded in standard analytic methods\
  \ as local tree or heterogeneous mean field approximations because of the bad tractability\
  \ of order statistics. We show how they become tractable in the thermodynamic limit\
  \ of infinite network size. This enables the analytic description of node attacks\
  \ that are characterized by threshold allocations based on node degree. Using two\
  \ examples, we discuss possible implications of irregular phase transitions and\
  \ different speeds of cascade evolution for the control of cascades."
