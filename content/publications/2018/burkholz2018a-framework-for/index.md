abstract: 'We present a framework to calculate the cascade size evolution for a large
  class of cascade models on random network ensembles in the limit of infinite network
  size. Our method is exact and applies to network ensembles with almost arbitrary
  degree distribution, degree-degree correlations and, in case of threshold models,
  for arbitrary threshold distribution. With our approach, we shift the perspective
  from the known branching process approximations to the iterative update of suitable
  probability distributions. Such distributions are key to capture cascade dynamics
  that involve possibly continuous quantities and that depend on the cascade history,
  e.g. if load is accumulated over time. As a proof of concept, we provide two examples:
  (a) Constant load models that cover many of the analytically tractable casacade
  models, and, as a highlight, (b) a fiber bundle model that was not tractable by
  branching process approximations before. Our derivations cover the whole cascade
  dynamics, not only their steady state. This allows to include interventions in time
  or further model complexity in the analysis.'
