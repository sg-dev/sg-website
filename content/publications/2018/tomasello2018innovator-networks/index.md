abstract: From the perspective of innovation economics evolving institutions, innovating
  entrepreneurs, technological change, and creative destruction are the driving force
  of economic growth (Schumpeter, 1942). To mitigate the uncertainty involved in the
  creation of new processes, products, or business models, innovation exhibits an
  intrinsic collaborative nature. Innovator networks form through formal and informal
  collaborations between different agents, including firms, institutions, universities,
  state agencies, inventors, and other stakeholders of the innovation system. Being
  embedded in a network enables these agents to coordinate innovative efforts, as
  well as to pool and jointly create knowledge.
