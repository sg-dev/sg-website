abstract: 'We introduce a broad class of random graph models: the generalised hypergeometric
  ensemble (GHypEG). This class enables to solve some long-standing problems in random
  graph theory. First, GHypEG provides an elegant and compact formulation of the well-known
  configuration model in terms of an urn problem. Second, GHypEG allows incorporating
  arbitrary tendencies to connect different vertex pairs. Third, we present the closed-form
  expressions of the associated probability distribution ensures the analytical tractability
  of our formulation. This is in stark contrast with the previous state-of-the-art,
  which is to implement the configuration model by means of computationally expensive
  procedures.'
