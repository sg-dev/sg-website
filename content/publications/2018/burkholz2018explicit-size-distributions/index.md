abstract: How big is the risk that a few initial failures of nodes in a network amplify
  to large cascades that span a substantial share of all nodes? Predicting the final
  cascade size is critical to ensure the functioning of a system as a whole. Yet,
  this task is hampered by uncertain or changing parameters and missing information.
  In infinitely large networks, the average cascade size can often be well estimated
  by established approaches building on local tree approximations and mean field approximations.
  Yet, as we demonstrate, in finite networks, this average does not even need to be
  a likely outcome. Instead, we find broad and even bimodal cascade size distributions.
  This phenomenon persists for system sizes up to 10 7 and different cascade models,
  i.e. it is relevant for most real systems. To show this, we derive explicit closed-form
  solutions for the full probability distribution of the final cascade size. We focus
  on two topological limit cases, the complete network representing a dense network
  with a very narrow degree distribution, and the star network representing a sparse
  network with a inhomogeneous degree distribution. Those topologies are of great
  interest, as they either minimize or maximize the average cascade size and are common
  motifs in many real world networks.
