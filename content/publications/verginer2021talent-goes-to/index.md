abstract: Global cities boast higher rates of innovation as measured through patent
  and scientific production. However, the source of the location advantage of innovation
  hubs is still debated in the literature, with arguments ranging from localized knowledge
  spillovers to network effects. Thanks to an extensive data set of individual scientist
  career paths, we shed new light on the role of scientist location choices in determining
  the superior innovative performance of global cities. We analyze the career paths
  of around two million researchers over a decade across more than two thousand cities
  around the globe. First, we show that scientists active in global cities are more
  productive in terms of citation weighted publications. We then show that this superior
  performance is in part driven by highly prolific scientists moving and remaining
  preferentially in global cities, i.e., central cities in the international scientist
  mobility network.  The overall picture that emerges is that global cities are better
  positioned to attract and retain prolific scientists than more peripheral cities.
