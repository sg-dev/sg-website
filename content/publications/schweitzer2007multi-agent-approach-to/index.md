abstract: Is it possible to link a set of nodes without using preexisting positional
  information or any kind of long-range attraction of the nodes? Can the process of
  generating positional information, i.e. the detection of ``unknown'' nodes and the
  estabishment of chemical gradients, emphand the process of network formation, i.e.
  the establishment of links between nodes, occur in parallel, on a comparable time
  scale, as a process of co-evolution? The paper discusses a model where the generation
  of relevant information for establishing the links between nodes results from the
  interaction of many emphagents, i.e. subunits of the system that are capable of
  performing some activities. Their collective interaction is based on (indirect)
  communication, which also includes memory effects and the dissemination of information
  in the system. The relevant (``pragmatic'') information that leads to the establishment
  of the links then emerges from an evolutionary interplay of selection and reamplification.
