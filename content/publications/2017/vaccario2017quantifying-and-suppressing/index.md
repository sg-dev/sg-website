abstract: It is widely recognized that citation counts for papers from different fields
  cannot be directly compared because different scientific fields adopt different
  citation practices. Citation counts are also strongly biased by paper age since
  older papers had more time to attract citations. Various procedures aim at suppressing
  these biases and give rise to new normalized indicators, such as the relative citation
  count. We use a large citation dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph and a new statistical
  framework based on the Mahalanobis distance to show that the rankings by well known
  indicators, including the relative citation count and Google's PageRank score, are
  significantly biased by paper field and age. Our statistical framework to assess
  ranking bias allows us to exactly quantify the contributions of each individual
  field to the overall bias of a given ranking. We propose a general normalization
  procedure motivated by the z-score which produces much less biased rankings when
  applied to citation count and PageRank score.
