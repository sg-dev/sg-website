abstract: 'We introduce a framework for the modeling of sequential data capturing
  pathways of varying lengths observed in a network. Such data are important, e.g.,
  when studying click streams in information networks, travel patterns in transportation
  systems, information cascades in social networks, biological pathways or time-stamped
  social interactions. While it is common to apply graph analytics and network analysis
  to such data, recent works have shown that temporal correlations can invalidate
  the results of such methods. This raises a fundamental question: when is a network
  abstraction of sequential data justified? Addressing this open question, we propose
  a framework which combines Markov chains of multiple, higher orders into a multi-layer
  graphical model that captures temporal correlations in pathways at multiple length
  scales simultaneously. We develop a model selection technique to infer the optimal
  number of layers of such a model and show that it outperforms previously used Markov
  order detection techniques. An application to eight real-world data sets on pathways
  and temporal networks shows that it allows to infer graphical models which capture
  both topological and temporal characteristics of such data. Our work highlights
  fallacies of network abstractions and provides a principled answer to the open question
  when they are justified. Generalizing network representations to multi-order graphical
  models, it opens perspectives for new data mining and knowledge discovery algorithms.'
