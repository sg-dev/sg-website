abstract: We develop a location analysis spatial model of firms' competition in multi-characteristics
  space, where consumers' opinions about the firms' products are distributed on multilayered
  networks. Firms do not compete on price but only on location upon the products'
  multi-characteristics space, and they aim to attract the maximum number of consumers.
  Boundedly rational consumers have distinct ideal points/tastes over the possible
  available firm locations but, crucially, they are affected by the opinions of their
  neighbors. Proposing a dynamic agent-based analysis on firms' location choice we
  characterize multi-dimensional product differentiation competition as adaptive learning
  by firms' managers and we argue that such a complex systems approach advances the
  analysis in alternative ways, beyond game-theoretic calculations.
