abstract: Online communication takes a variety of shapes in the different technological
  media that allow users interact with each other, with their friends, or with arbitrarily
  large groups. These serve as breeding grounds for collective emotions, in which
  large amounts of users share emotional states through time. We present our modeling
  framework for collective emotions in online communities, which can be adapted for
  the different kinds of online interaction present in the cyberspace. This framework
  allows the design of agent - based models, in which agentsâ€™ emotional states are
  represented according to psychological theories. This approach aims at a unification
  of modeling efforts, connecting the sentiment analysis of big data with psychological
  experiments, through tractable agent - based models. We illustrate the applications
  of this framework to different online communities, including product reviews, chatrooms,
  virtual realities, and social networking sites. We show how our model reproduces
  properties of collective emotions in the reviews of Amazon, and the group discussions
  of IRC channels. We comment the applications of this framework for data - driven
  simulation of emotions, and how we formulate testable hypotheses of emotion dynamics
  for future research on the field.
