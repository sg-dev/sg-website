abstract: In this manuscript, we show how higher-order graphical models can be applied
  to study the controllability of networked systems with dynamic topologies. Studying
  empirical data on temporal networks, we specifically show that the order correlations
  in the activation sequence of links can both increase or reduce the time needed
  to achieve full controllability. We then demonstrate how spectral properties of
  higher-order graphical models can be used to analytically explain the effect of
  order correlations on controllability in temporal networks.
