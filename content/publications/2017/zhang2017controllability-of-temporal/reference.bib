    abstract = "In this manuscript, we show how higher-order graphical models can be applied to study the controllability of networked systems with dynamic topologies. Studying empirical data on temporal networks, we specifically show that the order correlations in the activation sequence of links can both increase or reduce the time needed to achieve full controllability. We then demonstrate how spectral properties of higher-order graphical models can be used to analytically explain the effect of order correlations on controllability in temporal networks.",
