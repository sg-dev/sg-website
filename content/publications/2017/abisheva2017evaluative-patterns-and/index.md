abstract: Users of social media are not only producers and consumers of online content,
  they also evaluate each otherâ€™s content. Some social media include the possibility
  to down vote or dislike the content posted by other users, posing the risk that
  users who receive dislikes might be more likely to become inactive, especially if
  the disliked content is about a person. We analyzed the data on more than 150,000
  YouTube videos to understand how video impact and user incentives can be related
  to the possibility to dislike user content. We processed images related to videos
  to identify faces and quantify if evaluating content related to people is connected
  to disliking patterns. We found that videos with faces on their images tend to have
  less dislikes if they are posted by male users, but the effect is not present for
  female users. On the contrary, videos with faces and posted by female users attract
  more views and likes. Analyzing the probability of users to become inactive, we
  find that receiving dislikes is associated with users becoming inactive. This pattern
  is stronger when dislikes are given to videos with faces, showing that negative
  evaluations about people have a stronger association with user inactivity. Our results
  show that user evaluations in social media are a multi - faceted phenomenon that
  requires large - scale quantitative analyses, identifying under which conditions
  users disencourage other users from being active in social media.
