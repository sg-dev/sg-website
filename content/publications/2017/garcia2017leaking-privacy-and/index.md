abstract: Social interaction and data integration in the digital society can affect
  the control that individuals have on their privacy. Social networking sites can
  access data from other services, including user contact lists where nonusers are
  listed too. Although most research on online privacy has focused on inference of
  personal information of users, this data integration poses the question of whether
  it is possible to predict personal information of nonusers. This article tests the
  shadow profile hypothesis, which postulates that the data given by the users of
  an online service predict personal information of nonusers. Using data from a disappeared
  social networking site, we perform a historical audit to evaluate whether personal
  data of nonusers could have been predicted with the personal data and contact lists
  shared by the users of the site. We analyze personal information of sexual orientation
  and relationship status, which follow regular mixing patterns in the social network.
  Going back in time over the growth of the network, we measure predictor performance
  as a function of network size and tendency of users to disclose their contact lists.
  This article presents robust evidence supporting the shadow profile hypothesis and
  reveals a multiplicative effect of network size and disclosure tendencies that accelerates
  the performance of predictors. These results call for new privacy paradigms that
  take into account the fact that individual privacy decisions do not happen in isolation
  and are mediated by the decisions of others.
