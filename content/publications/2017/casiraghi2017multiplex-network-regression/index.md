abstract: We introduce a statistical method to investigate the impact of dyadic relations
  on complex networks generated from repeated interactions. It is based on generalised
  hypergeometric ensembles, a class of statistical network ensembles developed recently.
  We represent different types of known relations between system elements by weighted
  graphs, separated in the different layers of a multiplex network. With our method
  we can regress the influence of each relational layer, the independent variables,
  on the interaction counts, the dependent variables. Moreover, we can test the statistical
  significance of the relations as explanatory variables for the observed interactions.
  To demonstrate the power of our approach and its broad applicability, we will present
  examples based on synthetic and empirical data.
