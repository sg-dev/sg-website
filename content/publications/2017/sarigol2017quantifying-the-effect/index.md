abstract: In this article we study to what extent the academic peer review pro - cess
  is influenced by social relations between the authors of a manuscript and the editor
  handling the manuscript. Taking the Open Access journal PlosOne as a case study,
  our analysis is based on a data set of more than 100,000 articles pub - lished between
  2007 and 2015. Using available data on handling editor, submission and acceptance
  time of manuscripts, we study the question whether co - authorship relations between
  authors and the handling editor affect the manuscript handling time, i.e. the time
  taken between the submission and acceptance of a manuscript. Our analysis reveals
  (i) that editors handle papers co - authored by previous col - laborators significantly
  more often than expected at random, and (ii) that such prior co - author relations
  are significantly related to faster manuscript handling. Addressing the question
  whether these shorter manuscript handling times can be explained by the quality
  of publications, we study the number of citations and downloads which accepted papers
  eventually accumulate. Moreover, we consider the influence of additional (social)
  factors, such as the editor’s experience, the top - ical similarity between authors
  and editors, as well as reciprocal citation relations between authors and editors.
  Our findings show that, even when correcting for other factors like time, experience,
  and performance, prior co - authorship relations have a large and significant influence
  on manuscript handling times, speeding up the editorial decision on average by 19
  days.
