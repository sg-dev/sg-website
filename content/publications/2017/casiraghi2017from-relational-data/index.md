abstract: The inference of network topologies from relational data is an important
  problem in data analysis. Exemplary applications include the reconstruction of social
  ties from data on human interactions, the inference of gene co-expression networks
  from DNA microarray data, or the learning of semantic relationships based on co-occurrences
  of words in documents. Solving these problems requires techniques to infer significant
  links in noisy relational data. In this short paper, we propose a new statistical
  modeling framework to address this challenge. It builds on generalized hypergeometric
  ensembles, a class of generative stochastic models that give rise to analytically
  tractable probability spaces of directed, multi-edge graphs. We show how this framework
  can be used to assess the significance of links in noisy relational data. We illustrate
  our method in two data sets capturing spatio-temporal proximity relations between
  actors in a social system. The results show that our analytical framework provides
  a new approach to infer significant links from relational data, with interesting
  perspectives for the mining of data on social systems.
