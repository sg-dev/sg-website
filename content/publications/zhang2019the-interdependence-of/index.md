abstract: We propose a novel way to measure the reputation of firms by using information
  about their ownership structure. Supported by the signaling theory, we argue that
  ownership relations channel reputation spillovers between shareholders and their
  invested companies. We model such reputation spillovers by means of a simple dynamics
  that runs on the ownership network, constructed from available data bases. We focus
  on the core of the global ownership network with 1'300 firms and 12'100 ownership
  links. Our method assigns a ownership-based reputation value to each firm, used
  to provide a quantitative reputation ranking. We compare our ranking with alternative
  rankings, to confirm that the top ranked firms are correctly identified. We also
  demonstrate that our reputation measure does not correlate substantially with operating
  revenue or control and thus provides additional information about firms.
