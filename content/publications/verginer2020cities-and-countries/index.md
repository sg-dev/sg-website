abstract: Global mobility and migration of scientists is an important modern phenomenon
  with economic and political implications. As scientists become ever more footloose
  it is important to identify general patterns and regularities at a global scale
  and how it impacts a country's scientific output. The analysis of mobility and brain
  circulation patterns at global scale remains challenging, due to difficulties in
  obtaining individual level mobility data. In this work we trace intercity and international
  mobility through bibliographic records. We reconstruct the intercity and international
  mobility network of 3.7 million life scientists moving between 5 thousand cities
  and 189 Countries. In this exploratory analysis we offer evidence that international
  scientist mobility is marked by national borders and show that international mobility
  boosts the scientific output of selected countries.
