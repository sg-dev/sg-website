abstract: "We live in a computerized and networked society where many of our actions\
  \ leave a digital trace and affect other people's actions. This has lead to the\
  \ emergence of a new data-driven research field: mathematical methods of computer\
  \ science, statistical physics and sociometry provide insights on a wide range of\
  \ disciplines ranging from social science to human mobility. A recent important\
  \ discovery is that search engine traffic (i.e., the number of requests submitted\
  \ by users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and, in some cases,\
  \ to anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful examples include unemployment\
  \ levels, car and home sales, and epidemics spreading. Few recent works applied\
  \ this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However, it remains unclear\
  \ if trends in financial markets can be anticipated by the collective wisdom of\
  \ on-line users on the web. Here we show that daily trading volumes of stocks traded\
  \ in NASDAQ-100 are correlated with daily volumes of queries related to the same\
  \ stocks. In particular, query volumes anticipate in many cases peaks of trading\
  \ by one day or more. Our analysis is carried out on a unique dataset of queries,\
  \ submitted to an important web search engine, which enable us to investigate also\
  \ the user behavior. We show that the query volume dynamics emerges from the collective\
  \ but seemingly uncoordinated activity of many users. These findings contribute\
  \ to the debate on the identification of early warnings of financial systemic risk,\
  \ based on the activity of users of the www."
