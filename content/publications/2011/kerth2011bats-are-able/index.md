abstract: Elephants, dolphins, as well as some carnivores and primates maintain social
  links despite their frequent splitting and merging in groups of variable composition,
  a phenomenon known as fission-fusion. Information on the dynamics of social links
  and interactions among individuals is of high importance to the understanding of
  the evolution of animal sociality, including that of humans. However, detailed long-term
  data on such dynamics in wild mammals with fully known demography and kin structures
  are scarce. Applying a weighted network analysis on 20 500 individual roosting observations
  over 5 years, we show that in two wild Bechstein's bat colonies with high fission-fusion
  dynamics, individuals of different age, size, reproductive status and relatedness
  maintain long-term social relationships. In the larger colony, we detected two stable
  subunits, each comprising bats from several family lineages. Links between these
  subunits were mainly maintained by older bats and persisted over all years. Moreover,
  we show that the full details of the social structure become apparent only when
  large datasets are used. The stable multi-level social structures in Bechstein's
  bat colonies resemble that of elephants, dolphins and some primates. Our findings
  thus may shed new light on the link between social complexity and social cognition
  in mammals.
