abstract: We introduce a new model for the evolution of networks of firms exchanging
  knowledge in R&D partnerships. Innovation is assumed to result from the recombination
  of knowledge among firms in an R&D intensive industry. The decision of two firms
  to establish a new partnerships or to terminate an existing one, is based on their
  marginal revenues and costs, which in turn depend on the position they occupy in
  the network. Moreover, the formation of a collaboration has significant external
  effects on the other firms in the same connected component of the network. We show
  that this decentralized partner selection process leads to the existence of multiple
  equilibrium structures. Finally, by means of computer simulations, we study the
  properties of the emerging equilibrium networks and we show that they reproduce
  the stylized facts of R&D networks.
