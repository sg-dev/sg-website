abstract: 'The joint knowledge of many diverse individuals can outperform experts
  in estimation and decision - making problems. This wisdom of the crowd has been
  demonstrated in different societal areas such as internet search engines, political
  elections or stock markets. Recently, psychologists argued that humans may even
  simulate a diverse society in their own minds by drawing different answers from
  their brain (Vul & Pashler, 2008). The underlying idea is that individuals can access
  different knowledge areas in their brain, whose joint evaluation yields better estimates
  than their separate consideration. This article presents a mathematical treatment
  of the wisdom of crowds and two potential mechanisms to quantify the wisdom of crowds
  in one mind. The implications of both methods are analyzed and applied to new experimental
  data (N = 144), which contain five consecutive estimates from the same individuals.
  The theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates limitations of the wisdom of
  crowds in one mind: Asking oneself several times is on average less powerful than
  asking only one other individual. This is due to the smaller diversity of estimates
  of similar individuals and the larger average bias to which they converge. Further,
  individuals cannot perform independent draws from an ‘‘internal distribution’’.
  Hence, there may be other mechanisms at work such as talking oneself into believing
  initial guesses or eliciting progressively wilder ones. ©2010'
