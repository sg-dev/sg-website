abstract: We develop an agent - based model of the motion and pattern formation of
  vesicles. These intracellular particles can be found in four different modes of
  (undirected and directed) motion and can fuse with other vesicles. While the size
  of vesicles follows a log - normal distribution that changes over time due to fusion
  processes, their spatial distribution gives rise to distinct patterns. Their occurrence
  depends on the concentration of proteins which are synthesized based on the transcriptional
  activities of some genes. Hence, differences in these spatio - temporal vesicle
  patterns allow indirect conclusions about the (unknown) impact of these genes. By
  means of agent - based computer simulations we are able to reproduce such patterns
  on real temporal and spatial scales. Our modeling approach is based on Brownian
  agents with an internal degree of freedom, $θ$, that represents the different modes
  of motion. Conditions inside the cell are modeled by an effective potential that
  differs for agents dependent on their value $θ$. Agent’s motion in this effective
  potential is modeled by an overdampted Langevin equation, changes of $θ$ are modeled
  as stochastic transitions with values obtained from experiments, and fusion events
  are modeled as space - dependent stochastic transitions. Our results for the spatio
  - temporal vesicle patterns can be used for a statistical comparison with experiments.
  We also derive hypotheses of how the silencing of some genes may affect the intracellular
  transport, and point to generalizations of the model.
