abstract: We have discovered 12 independent new empirical scaling laws in foreign
  exchange data-series that hold for close to three orders of magnitude and across
  13 currency ex-change rates. Our statistical analysis crucially depends on an event-based
  approach that measures the relationship between different types of events. The scaling
  laws give an accurate estimation of the length of the price-curve coastline, which
  turns out to be surprisingly long. The new laws substantially extend the catalogue
  of stylised facts and sharply constrain the space of possible theoretical explanations
  of the mar-ket mechanisms.
