abstract: The structure of the control network of transnational corporations affects
  global market competition and financial stability. So far, only small national samples
  were studied and there was no appropriate methodology to assess control globally.
  We present the first investigation of the architecture of the international ownership
  network, along with the computation of the control held by each global player. We
  find that transnational corporations form a giant bow-tie structure and that a large
  portion of control flows to a small tightly-knit core of financial institutions.
  This core can be seen as an economic \"super-entity\" that raises new important
  issues both for researchers and policy makers.
