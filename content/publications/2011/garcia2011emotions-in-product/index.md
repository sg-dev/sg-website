abstract: Online communities provide Internet users with means to overcome some information
  barriers and constraints, such as the difficulty to gather independent information
  about products and firms. Product review communities allow customers to share their
  opinions and emotions after the purchase of a product. We introduce a new dataset
  of product reviews from Amazon.com, with emotional information extracted by sentiment
  detection tools. Our statistical analysis of this data provides evidence for the
  existence of polemic reviews, as well as for the coexistence of positive and negative
  emotions inside reviews. We find a strong bias towards large values in the expression
  of positive emotions, while negative ones are more evenly distributed. We identified
  different time dynamics of the creation of reviews dependent on the presence of
  marketing and word of mouth effects. We define an agent-based model of the users
  of product review communities using a modeling framework for online emotions. This
  model can reproduce the scenarios of response to external influences, as well as
  some properties of the distributions of positive and negative emotions expressed
  in product reviews. This analysis and model can provide guidelines to manufacturers
  on how to increase customer satisfaction and how to measure the emotional impact
  of marketing campaigns through reviews data.
