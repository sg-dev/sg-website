abstract: 'Based on the analysis of the dependency network in 18 Java projects, we
  develop a novel model of network growth which considers both preferential attachment
  and the addition of new nodes with a heterogeneous distribution of their initial
  degree, k0. Empirically we find that the cumulative distributions of initial and
  final degrees in the network follow power law behaviours: 1−P(k0)∝k1−$α$ as a function
  of the network size, we find empirically K(N)∝N$β$,where $β$ ∈[1.25, 2] (for small
  N), while converging to $β$ ∼1 for large N. This indicates a transition from a growth
  regime with increasing network density towards a sustainable regime, which prevents
  a collapse due to 0 ,and 1−P(k)∝k1−$γ$, respectively. For the total number of links
  ever increasing dependencies. Our theoretical framework allows us to predict relations
  between the exponents $α$, $β$, $γ$, which also link issues of software engineering
  and developer activity. These relations are verified by means of computer simulations
  and empirical investigations. They indicate that the growth of real Open Source
  Software networks occurs on the edge between two regimes, which are dominated either
  by the initial degree distribution of added nodes, or by the preferential attachment
  mechanism. Hence, the heterogeneous degree distribution of newly added nodes, found
  empirically, is essential to describe the laws of sustainable growth in networks.'
