abstract: We study the evolution of fast blackout cascades in the model of the Polish
  (transmission) power grid (2700 nodes and 3504 transmission lines). The cascade
  is initiated by a sufficiently severe initial contingency tripping. It propagates
  via sequential trippings of many more overheated lines, islanding loads and generators
  and eventually arriving at a fixed point with the surviving part of the system being
  power-flow-balanced and the rest of the system being outaged. Utilizing an improved
  form of the quasi-static model for cascade propagation introduced in our earlier
  study (Statistical Classification of Cascading Failures in Power Grids, IEEE PES
  GM 2011), we analyze how the severity of the cascade depends on the order of tripping
  overheated lines. Our main observation is that the order of tripping has a tremendous
  effect on the size of the resulting outage. Finding the \"best\" tripping, defined
  as causing the least damage, constitutes a difficult dynamical optimization problem,
  whose solution is most likely computationally infeasible. Instead, here we study
  performance of a number of natural heuristics, resolving the next switching decision
  based on the current state of the grid. Overall, we conclude that controlled intentional
  tripping is advantageous in the situation of a fast developing extreme emergency,
  as it provides significant mitigation of the resulting damage.
