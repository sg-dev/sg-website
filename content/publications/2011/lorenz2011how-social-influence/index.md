abstract: Social groups can be remarkably smart and knowledgeable when their averaged
  judgements are compared with the judgements of individuals. Already Galton [Galton
  F (1907) Nature 75:7] found evidence that the median estimate of a group can be
  more accu - rate than estimates of experts. This wisdom of crowd effect was recently
  supported by examples from stock markets, political elections, and quiz shows [Surowiecki
  J (2004) The Wisdom of Crowds]. In contrast, we demonstrate by experimental evidence
  (N = 144) that even mild social influence can undermine the wisdom of crowd effect
  in simple estimation tasks. In the exper - iment, subjects could reconsider their
  response to factual ques - tions after having received average or full information
  of the responses of other subjects. We compare subjects’ convergence of estimates
  and improvements in accuracy over five consecutive estimation periods with a control
  condition, in which no informa - tion about others’ responses was provided. Although
  groups are initially “wise,” knowledge about estimates of others narrows the diversity
  of opinions to such an extent that it undermines the wisdom of crowd effect in three
  different ways. The “social influence effect” diminishes the diversity of the crowd
  without improvements of its collective error. The “range reduction effect” moves
  the position of the truth to peripheral regions of the range of estimates so that
  the crowd becomes less reliable in providing expertise for external observers. The
  “confidence ef - fect” boosts individuals’ confidence after convergence of their
  estimates despite lack of improved accuracy. Examples of the revealed mechanism
  range from misled elites to the recent global financial crisis.
