abstract: We introduce a new microscopic model of the outages in transmission power
  grids. This model accounts for the automatic response of the grid to load fluctuations
  that take place on the scale of minutes, when the optimum power flow adjustments
  and load shedding controls are unavailable. We describe extreme events, initiated
  by load fluctuations, which cause cascading failures of loads, generators and lines.
  Our model is quasi-static in the causal, discrete time and sequential resolution
  of individual failures. The model, in its simplest realization based on the Directed
  Current description of the power flow problem, is tested on three standard IEEE
  systems consisting of 30, 39 and 118 buses. Our statistical analysis suggests a
  straightforward classification of cascading and islanding phases in terms of the
  ratios between average number of removed loads, generators and links. The analysis
  also demonstrates sensitivity to variations in line capacities. Future research
  challenges in modeling and control of cascading outages over real-world power networks
  are discussed.
