abstract: 'Technological artifacts such as software often comprise a large number
  of modules; more than twenty thousand in the case of the Java software Eclipse.
  While on the micro-level this system is modular, how should the building blocks
  be arranged on the macro-level? In the literature this question has mainly been
  addressed with the same arguments already used to advocate modularity on the micro-level:
  Dependencies should be minimized as they impede optimization and flexibility of
  the system. In contrast to this I argue that along with a change from the micro
  view to the macro view also the argumentation has to change. In this paper, I analyze
  the theoretical ramifications of dependency between modules on the macro-level.
  In particular, I argue that macro-level dependencies are first weak dependencies,
  and second, foster flexibility and change efficiency. This argumentation is supported
  by an empirical analysis of 35 software architectures. Data show that dependency
  relations seldom cause change propagation. Furthermore, high dependency in the architecture
  negatively correlates with the occurrence of large change events. Thus, higher interdependency
  is associated with higher evolvability and more efficient change.'
