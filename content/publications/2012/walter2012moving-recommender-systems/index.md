abstract: 'The increasing diversity of consumersâ€™ demand, as documented by the debate
  on the long tail of the distribution of sales volume across products, represents
  a challenge for retail stores. Recommender systems offer a tool to cope with this
  challenge. The recent developments in information technology and ubiquitous computing
  makes it feasible to move recommender systems from the online commerce, where
  they are widely used, to retail stores. In this paper, we aim to bridge the management
  literature and the computer science literature by analysing a number of issues that
  arise when applying recommender systems to retail stores. These range from the format
  of the stores that would benefit most from recommender systems to the impact of
  coverage and control of recommender systems on customer loyalty and competition
  among retail stores.'
