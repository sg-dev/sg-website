abstract: Science is changing, all the time. Some consider external factors to be
  the major driving force, such as new discoveries, or new technologies that provide
  deeper insights into known systems. Others consider internal factors to be more
  important, such as the never-ending search for eternal truths or, at least, for
  the theoretical unification of diverse observations. Yet others believe that science
  is a social endeavor and its evolution is governed by forces very similar to those
  that cause fashions to change, with new research topics seeming to catch our attention
  and established topics falling out of vogue. We have come to believe that all of
  these arguments apply, and that the various impacts on scientific progress are even
  mutually dependent. Fashionable topics co-evolve with technological advances, as
  do new discoveries with overarching theories.
