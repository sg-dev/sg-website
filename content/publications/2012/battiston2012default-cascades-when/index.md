abstract: Software development depends on many factors, including technical, human
  and social aspects. Due to the complexity of this dependence, a unifying framework
  must be defined and for this purpose we adopt the complex networks methodology.
  We use a data-driven approach based on a large collection of open source software
  projects extracted from online project development platforms. The preliminary results
  presented in this article reveal that the network perspective yields key insights
  into the sustainability of software development.
