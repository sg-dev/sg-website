abstract: We show that the frequency of word use is not only determined by the word
  length [1] and the average information content [2], but also by its emotional content.We
  have analysed three established lexica of affective word usage in English, German,
  and Spanish, to verify that these lexica have a neutral, unbiased, emotional content.
  Taking into account the frequency of word usage, we find that words with a positive
  emotional content are more frequently used. This lends support to Pollyanna hypothesis
  [3] that there should be a positive bias in human expression. We also find that
  negative words contain more information than positive words, as the informativeness
  of a word increases uniformly with its valence decrease. Our findings support earlier
  conjectures about (i) the relation between word frequency and information content,
  and (ii) the impact of positive emotions on communication and social links.
