abstract: We present a generalized method for calculating the k-shell structure of
  weighted networks. The method takes into account both the weight and the degree
  of a network, in such a way that in the absence of weights we resume the shell structure
  obtained by the classic k-shell decomposition. In the presence of weights, we show
  that the method is able to partition the network in a more refined way, without
  the need of any arbitrary threshold on the weight values. Furthermore, by simulating
  spreading processes using the susceptible-infectious-recovered model in four different
  weighted real-world networks, we show that the weighted k-shell decomposition method
  ranks the nodes more accurately, by placing nodes with higher spreading potential
  into shells closer to the core. In addition, we demonstrate our new method on a
  real economic network and show that the core calculated using the weighted k-shell
  method is more meaningful from an economic perspective when compared with the unweighted
  one.
