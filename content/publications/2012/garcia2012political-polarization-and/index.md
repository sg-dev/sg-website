abstract: We present our approach to online popularity and its applications to political
  science, aiming at the creation of agentbased models that reproduce patterns of
  popularity in participatory media. We illustrate our approach analyzing a dataset
  from Youtube, composed of the view statistics andcomments for the videos of the
  U.S. presidential campaigns of 2008 and 2012. Using sentiment analysis, we quantify
  the collective emotions expressed by the viewers, ﬁnding that democrat campaigns
  elicited more positive collective emotions than republican campaigns. Techniques
  from computational social science allow us to measure virality of the videos of
  each campaign, to ﬁnd that democrat videos are shared faster but republican ones
  are remembered longer inside the community. Last we present our work in progress
  in voting advice applications, and our results analyzing thedata from choose4greece.com.
  We show how we assess the policy diﬀerences between parties and their voters, and
  how voting advice applications can be extended to test our agentbased models.
