abstract: We investigate the efficiency and stability of R&D networks in a model with
  network-dependent indirect spillovers. We show that the efficient network structure
  critically depends on the marginal cost of R&D collaborations. When the marginal
  cost is low, the complete graph is efficient, while high marginal costs imply that
  the efficient network is asymmetric and has a nested structure. Regarding the stability
  of network structures, we show the existence of both symmetric and asymmetric equilibria.
  The efficient network is stable for small industry size and small cost. In contrast,
  for large industry size, there is a wide region of cost in which the efficient network
  is not stable. This implies a divergence between efficiency and stability in large
  industries.
