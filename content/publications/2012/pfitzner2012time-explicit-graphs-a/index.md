abstract: When dealing with networks of several kind, network theory provides the
  theoretical framework and the practical tools to analyze them. Mostly analysis focuses
  on steady networks, i.e. networks with ﬁxed topology. However, real - world scenarios
  often deal with (highly) dynamic topologies. As of today, the question of how to
  investigate such scenarios, e.g. deﬁning a meaningful notion of “temporal centrality”,
  has generally not been answered. In this poster we present research pointing out
  the obstacles arising in this endeavor as well as a possible framework to address
  those issues, which we call time - explicit graphs.
