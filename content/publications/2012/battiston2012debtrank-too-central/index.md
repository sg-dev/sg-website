abstract: Systemic risk, here meant as the risk of default of a large portion of the
  financial system, depends on the network of financial exposures among institutions.
  However, there is no widely accepted methodology to determine the systemically important
  nodes in a network. To fill this gap, we introduce, DebtRank, a novel measure of
  systemic impact inspired by feedback-centrality. As an application, we analyse a
  new and unique dataset on the USD 1.2 trillion FED emergency loans program to global
  financial institutions during 2008-2010. We find that a group of 22 institutions,
  which received most of the funds, form a strongly connected graph where each of
  the nodes becomes systemically important at the peak of the crisis. Moreover, a
  systemic default could have been triggered even by small dispersed shocks. The results
  suggest that the debate on too-big-to-fail institutions should include the even
  more serious issue of too-central-to-fail.
