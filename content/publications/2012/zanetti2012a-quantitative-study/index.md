abstract: The success of open source projects crucially depends on the voluntary contributions
  of a suf - ﬁciently large community of users. Apart from the mere size of the community,
  interestingquestions arises when looking at the evolution of structural features
  of collaborations betweencommunity members. In this article, we discuss several
  network analytic proxies that can beused to quantify diﬀerent aspects of the social
  organisation in social collaboration networks. Weparticularly focus on measures
  that can be related to the cohesiveness of the communities, thedistribution of responsibilities
  and the resilience against turnover of community members. Wepresent a comparative
  analysis on a large - scale data set that covers the full history of collabor -
  ations between users of 14 major open source software communities. Our analysis
  covers bothaggregate and time - evolving measures and highlights diﬀerences in the
  social organisation acrosscommunities. We argue that our results are a promising
  ﬁrst step towards the deﬁnition ofsuitable, potentially multi - dimensional, resilience
  and risk indicators for open source softwarecommunities.
