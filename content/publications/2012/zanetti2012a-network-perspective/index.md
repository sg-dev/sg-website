abstract: Modularity is a desirable characteristic for software systems. In this article
  we propose to use a quantitative method from complex network sciences to estimate
  the coherence between the modularity of the dependency network of large open source
  Java projects and their decomposition in terms of Java packages. The results presented
  in this article indicate that our methodology offers a promising and reasonable
  quantitative approach with potential impact on software engineering processes.
