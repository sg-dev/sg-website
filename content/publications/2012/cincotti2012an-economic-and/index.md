abstract: This paper describes the vision of a European Exploratory for economics
  and finance using an interdisciplinary consortium of economists, natural scientists,
  computer scientists and engineers, who will combine their expertise to address the
  enormous challenges of the 21st century. This Academic Public facility is intended
  for economic modelling, investigating all aspects of risk and stability, improving
  financial technology, and evaluating proposed regulatory and taxation changes. The
  European Exploratory for economics and finance will be constituted as a network
  of infrastructure, observatories, data repositories, services and facilities and
  will foster the creation of a new cross-disciplinary research community of social
  scientists, complexity scientists and computing (ICT) scientists to collaborate
  in investigating major issues in economics and finance. It is also considered a
  cradle for training and collaboration with the private sector to spur spin-offs
  and job creations in Europe in the finance and economic sectors. The Exploratory
  will allow Social Scientists and Regulators as well as Policy Makers and the private
  sector to conduct realistic investigations with real economic, financial and social
  data. The Exploratory will (i) continuously monitor and evaluate the status of the
  economies of countries in their various components, (ii) use, extend and develop
  a large variety of methods including data mining, process mining, computational
  and artificial intelligence and every other computer and complex science techniques
  coupled with economic theory and econometric, and (iii) provide the framework and
  infrastructure to perform what-if analysis, scenario evaluations and computational,
  laboratory, field and web experiments to inform decision makers and help develop
  innovative policy, market and regulation designs.
