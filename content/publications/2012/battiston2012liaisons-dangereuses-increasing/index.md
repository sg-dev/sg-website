abstract: The recent financial crisis poses the challenge to understand how systemic
  risk arises endogenously and what architecture can make the financial system more
  resilient to global crises. This paper shows that a financial network can be most
  resilient for intermediate levels of risk diversification, and not when this is
  maximal, as generally thought so far. This finding holds in the presence of the
  financial accelerator, i.e. when negative variations in the financial robustness
  of an agent tend to persist in time because they have adverse effects on the agent's
  subsequent performance through the reaction of the agent's counterparties.
