abstract: How do users behave in online chatrooms, where they instantaneously read
  and write posts? We analyzed about 2.5 million posts covering various topics in
  Internet relay channels, and found that user activity patterns follow known power
  - law and stretched exponential distributions, indicating that online chat activity
  is not different from other forms of communication. Analysing the emotional expressions
  (positive, negative, neutral) of users, we revealed a remarkable persistence both
  for individual users and channels. I.e. despite their anonymity, users tend to follow
  social norms in repeated interactions in online chats, which results in a specific
  emotional “tone” of the channels. We provide an agent - based model of emotional
  interaction, which recovers qualitatively both the activity patterns in chatrooms
  and the emotional persistence of users and channels. While our assumptions about
  agent's emotional expressions are rooted in psychology, the model allows to test
  different hypothesis regarding their emotional impact in online communication.
