abstract: A common phenomenon on the Internet is the appearance of collective emotions,
  in which many users share an emotional state. Online communities allow users to
  emotionally interact with large amounts of other users, creating collective states
  faster than in offline interaction. We present our modeling framework for collective
  emotions in online communities. This framework allows the analysis and design of
  agent-based models, including the dynamics of psychological states under emotional
  interaction. We illustrate the applications of our framework through an overview
  of two different models. Based on this framework, our first model of emotions in
  product reviews communities reproduces the empirical distribution of emotions towards
  products in Amazon. The second model within our framework reproduces the emergence
  of emotional persistence at the individual and collective level. This persistence
  pattern is similar to the one revealed by our statistical analysis of IRC chatrooms.
  Further applications of our framework aim at reproducing collective features of
  emotions in a variety of online communities.
