    abstract = "Software development depends on many factors, including technical, human and social aspects. Due to the complexity of this dependence, a unifying framework must be defined and for this purpose we adopt the complex networks methodology. We use a data-driven approach based on a large collection of open source software projects extracted from online project development platforms. The preliminary results presented in this article reveal that the network perspective yields key insights into the sustainability of software development.",
