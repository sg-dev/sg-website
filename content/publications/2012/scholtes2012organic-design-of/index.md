abstract: The vision of Organic Computing addresses challenges that arise in the design
  of future information systems that are comprised of numerous, heterogeneous, resource-constrained
  and error-prone components. The notion organic highlights the idea that, in order
  to be manageable, such systems should exhibit self-organization, self-adaptation
  and self-healing characteristics similar to those of biological systems. In recent
  years, the principles underlying these characteristics are increasingly being investigated
  from the perspective of complex systems science, particularly using the conceptual
  framework of statistical physics and statistical mechanics. In this article, we
  review some of the interesting relations between statistical physics and networked
  systems and discuss applications in the engineering of organic overlay networks
  with predictable macroscopic properties.
