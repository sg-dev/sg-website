abstract: A huge flow of quantitative social, demographic and behavioral data is becoming
  available that traces the activities and interactions of individuals, social patterns,
  transportation infrastructures and travel fluxes. This has caused, together with
  innovative computational techniques and methods for modeling social actions in hybrid
  (natural and artificial) societies, a qualitative change in the ways we model socio-technical
  systems. For the first time, society can be studied in a comprehensive fashion that
  addresses social and behavioral complexity. In other words we are in the position
  to envision the development of large data and computational cyber infrastructure
  defining an exploratory of society that provides quantitative anticipatory, explanatory
  and scenario analysis capabilities ranging from emerging infectious disease to conflict
  and crime surges. The goal of the exploratory of society is to provide the basic
  infrastructure embedding the framework of tools and knowledge needed for the design
  of forecast/anticipatory/crisis management approaches to socio technical systems,
  supporting future decision making procedures by accelerating the scientific cycle
  that goes from data generation to predictions.
