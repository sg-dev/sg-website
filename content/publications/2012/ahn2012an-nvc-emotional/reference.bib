    abstract = "This paper proposes a new emotional model for Virtual Humans (VHs) in a conversational environment. As a part of a multi - users emotional 3D - chatting system, this paper focus on how to formulate and visualize the ﬂow of emotional state deﬁned by the Valence - ArousalDominance (VAD) parameters. From this ﬂow of emotion over time, we successfully visualized the change of VHs’ emotional state through the proposed emoFaces and emoMotions. The notion of Non - Verbal Communication (NVC) was exploited for driving plausible emotional expressions during conversation. With the help of a proposed interface, where a user can parameterize emotional state and ﬂow, we succeeded to vary the emotional expressions and reactions of VHs in a 3D conversation scene.",
