abstract: This paper proposes a new emotional model for Virtual Humans (VHs) in a
  conversational environment. As a part of a multi - users emotional 3D - chatting
  system, this paper focus on how to formulate and visualize the ﬂow of emotional
  state deﬁned by the Valence - ArousalDominance (VAD) parameters. From this ﬂow of
  emotion over time, we successfully visualized the change of VHs’ emotional state
  through the proposed emoFaces and emoMotions. The notion of Non - Verbal Communication
  (NVC) was exploited for driving plausible emotional expressions during conversation.
  With the help of a proposed interface, where a user can parameterize emotional state
  and ﬂow, we succeeded to vary the emotional expressions and reactions of VHs in
  a 3D conversation scene.
