abstract: Related to the often applied cooperation models of social dilemmas, we deal
  with scenarios in which defection dominates cooperation, but an intermediate fraction
  of cooperators, that is, “partial cooperation,” would maximize the overall performance
  of a group of individuals. Of course, such a solution comes at the expense of cooperators
  that do not profit from the overall maximum. However, because there are mechanisms
  accounting for mutual benefits after repeated interactions or through evolutionary
  mechanisms, such situations can constitute “dilemmas” of partial cooperation. Among
  the 12 ordinally distinct, symmetrical 2 × 2 games, three (barely considered) variants
  are correspondents of such dilemmas. Whereas some previous studies investigated
  particular instances of such games, we here provide the unifying framework and concisely
  relate it to the broad literature on cooperation in social dilemmas. Complementing
  our argumentation, we study the evolution of partial cooperation by deriving the
  respective conditions under which coexistence of cooperators and defectors, that
  is, partial cooperation, can be a stable outcome of evolutionary dynamics in these
  scenarios. Finally, we discuss the relevance of such models for research on the
  large biodiversity and variation in cooperative efforts both in biological and social
  systems.
