abstract: 'We propose a network description of large market investments, where both
  stocks and shareholders are represented as vertices connected by weighted links
  corresponding to shareholdings. In this framework, the in - degree (kin) and the
  sum of incoming link weights (v) of an investor correspond to the number of assets
  held (portfolio diversification) and to the invested wealth (portfolio volume),
  respectively. An empirical analysis of three different real markets reveals that
  the distributions of both kin and v display power - law tails with exponents g and
  a: Moreover, we find that kin scales as a power - law function of v with an exponent
  b: Remarkably, despite the values of a; b and g differ across the three markets,
  they are always governed by the scaling relation b ¼ð1aÞ = ð1gÞ: We show that
  these empirical findings can be reproduced by a recent model relating the emergence
  of scale - free networks to an underlying Paretian distribution of ‘hidden’ vertex
  properties.'
