      abstract={We study the effect of group interactions on the emergence of consensus in a spin system.
Agents with discrete opinions (0, 1) form groups. They can change their opinion based on
their group’s influence (voter dynamics), but groups can also split and merge (adaptation). In
a hypergraph, these groups are represented by hyperedges of different sizes. The heterogeneity
of group sizes is controlled by a parameter β. To study the impact of β on reaching consensus,
we provide extensive computer simulations and compare them with an analytic approach for
the dynamics of the average magnetization. We find that group interactions amplify small
initial opinion biases, accelerate the formation of consensus and lead to a drift of the average
magnetization. The conservation of the initial magnetization, known for basic voter models,
is no longer obtained.},
