abstract: We study the effect of group interactions on the emergence of consensus
  in a spin system. Agents with discrete opinions (0, 1) form groups. They can change
  their opinion based on their group’s influence (voter dynamics), but groups can
  also split and merge (adaptation). In a hypergraph, these groups are represented
  by hyperedges of different sizes. The heterogeneity of group sizes is controlled
  by a parameter β. To study the impact of β on reaching consensus, we provide extensive
  computer simulations and compare them with an analytic approach for the dynamics
  of the average magnetization. We find that group interactions amplify small initial
  opinion biases, accelerate the formation of consensus and lead to a drift of the
  average magnetization. The conservation of the initial magnetization, known for
  basic voter models, is no longer obtained.
