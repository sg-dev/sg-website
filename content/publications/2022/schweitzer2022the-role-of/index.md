abstract: 'We use a data-driven agent-based model to study the coreâ€“periphery structure
  of two collaboration networks, R&D alliances between firms and co-authorship relations
  between scientists. To characterize the network embeddedness of agents, we introduce
  a coreness value obtained from a weighted k-core decomposition. We study the change
  of these coreness values when collaborations with newcomers or established agents
  are formed. Our agent-based model is able to reproduce the empirical coreness differences
  of collaboration partners and to explain why we observe a change in partner selection
  for agents with high network embeddedness.'
