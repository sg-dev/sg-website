abstract: " Online platforms face pressure to keep their communities civil and respectful.\
  \ Thus, the bannings of problematic online communities from mainstream platforms\
  \ like Reddit and Facebook are often met with enthusiastic public reactions. However,\
  \ this policy can lead users to migrate to alternative fringe platforms with lower\
  \ moderation standards and where antisocial behaviors like trolling and harassment\
  \ are widely accepted. As users of these communities often remain co-acttive across\
  \ mainstream and fringe platforms, antisocial behaviors may spill over onto the\
  \ mainstream platform. We study this possible spillover by analyzing around 70,000\
  \ users from three banned communities that migrated to fringe platforms: r/The_Donald,\
  \ r/GenderCritical, and r/Incels. Using a difference-in-differences design, we contrast\
  \ co-active users with matched counterparts to estimate the causal effect of fringe\
  \ platform participation on users' antisocial behavior on Reddit. Our results show\
  \ that participating in the fringe communities increases users' toxicity on Reddit\
  \ (as measured by Perspective API) and involvement with subreddits similar to the\
  \ banned community -- which often also breach platform norms. The effect intensifies\
  \ with time and exposure to the fringe platform. In short, we find evidence for\
  \ a spillover of antisocial behavior from fringe platforms onto Reddit via co-participation."
