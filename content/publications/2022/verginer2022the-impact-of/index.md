abstract: In high-tech industries, where intellectual property plays a crucial role,
  the acquisition of intangible assets and employees' tacit knowledge is an integral
  part of the motivation for Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As). Following the molecular
  biology revolution, the wave of takeovers in the biotechnology industry in the Nineties
  is a well-known example of M&As to absorb new knowledge. The retention of critical
  R&D employees embodying valuable knowledge and potential future innovation is uncertain
  after an acquisition. While not all employees might be relevant for the success
  of the takeover, inventors are among the most valuable. This is especially true
  for the acquisition of an innovative start-up. This paper estimates how likely an
  inventor working for an acquired biotechnology company will leave. We find that
  inventors affected by acquisitions are 20% more likely to leave the company by a
  difference-in-differences approach matching both firms and inventors.
