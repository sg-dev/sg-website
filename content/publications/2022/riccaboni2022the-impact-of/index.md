abstract: The COVID-19 outbreak has posed an unprecedented challenge to humanity and
  science. On the one side, public and private incentives have been put in place to
  promptly allocate resources toward research areas strictly related to the COVID-19
  emergency. However, research in many fields not directly related to the pandemic
  has been displaced. In this paper, we assess the impact of COVID-19 on world scientific
  production in the life sciences and find indications that the usage of medical subject
  headings (MeSH) has changed following the outbreak. We estimate through a difference-in-differences
  approach the impact of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic on scientific production
  using the PubMed database (3.6 Million research papers). We find that COVID-19-related
  MeSH terms have experienced a 6.5 fold increase in output on average, while publications
  on unrelated MeSH terms dropped by 10 to 12%. The publication weighted impact has
  an even more pronounced negative effect (-16% to -19%). Moreover, COVID-19 has displaced
  clinical trial publications (-24%) and diverted grants from research areas not closely
  related to COVID-19. Note that since COVID-19 publications may have been fast-tracked,
  the sudden surge in COVID-19 publications might be driven by editorial policy.
