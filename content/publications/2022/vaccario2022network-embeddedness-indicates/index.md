abstract: " Firms' innovation potential depends on their position in the R&D network.\
  \ But details on this relation remain unclear because measures to quantify network\
  \ embeddedness have been controversially discussed. We propose and validate a new\
  \ measure, coreness, obtained from the weighted k-core decomposition of the R&D\
  \ network. Using data on R&D alliances, we analyse the change of coreness for 14,000\
  \ firms over 25 years and patenting activity. A regression analysis demonstrates\
  \ that coreness explains firms' R&D output by predicting future patenting."
