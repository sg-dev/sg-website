abstract: We evaluate the robustness and adaptivity of social groups with heterogeneous
  agents that are characterized by their binary state, their ability to change this
  state, their status and their preferred relations to other agents.  To define group
  structures, we operationalize the hexagrams of the I Ching.  The relations and
  properties of agents are used to quantify their influence according to the social
  impact theory.  From these influence values we derive a weighted stability measure
  for triads involving three agents, which is based on the weighted balance theory.  It
  allows to quantify the robustness of groups and to propose a novel measure for group
  resilience which combines robustness and adaptivity.  A stochastic approach determines
  the probabilities to find robust and adaptive groups.  The discussion focuses on
  the generalization of our approach.
