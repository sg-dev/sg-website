abstract: 'In the U.S. Congress, legislators can use active and passive cosponsorship
  to support bills.We show that these two types of cosponsorship are driven by two
  different motivations: the backing of political colleagues and the backing of the
  billâ€²s content.To this end, we develop an Encoder+RGCN based model that learns legislator
  representations from bill texts and speech transcripts. These representations predict
  active and passive cosponsorship with an F1-score of 0.88.Applying our representations
  to predict voting decisions, we show that they are interpretable and generalize
  to unseen tasks.'
