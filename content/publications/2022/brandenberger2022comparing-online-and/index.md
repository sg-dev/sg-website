abstract: Do politicians carry on their interpersonal relations online? We
  examine how online political support compares to offline support. We overlay two
  data sets on political support among members of the Swiss National Council to estimate
  the explanatory power of online endorsements on offline cosponsorship signatures
  among members, using a gHypEG network regression model. Whereas offline support
  behavior is driven by a broad range of factors, such as network and homophily effects,
  endorsement is less diverse. Our findings show that online endorsement is predominantly
  driven by partisanship and does not mirror the richness found in offline support
  behavior.
