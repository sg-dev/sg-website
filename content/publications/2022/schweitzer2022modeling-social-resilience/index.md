abstract: 'Resilience denotes the capacity of a system to withstand shocks and its
  ability to recover from them.  We develop a framework to quantify the resilience
  of highly volatile, non-equilibrium social organizations, such as collectives or
  collaborating teams.  It consists of four steps: (i) emphdelimitation, i.e., narrowing
  down the target systems, (ii) emphconceptualization, i.e., identifying how to approach
  social organizations, (iii) formal emphrepresentation using a combination of agent-based
  and network models, (iv) emphoperationalization, i.e. specifying measures and demonstrating
  how they enter the calculation of resilience.  Our framework quantifies two dimensions
  of resilience, the emphrobustness of social organizations and their emphadaptivity,
  and combines them in a novel resilience measure.  It allows monitoring resilience
  instantaneously using longitudinal data instead of an ex-post evaluation.  '
