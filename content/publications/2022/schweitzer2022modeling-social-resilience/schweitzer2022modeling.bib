  abstract =	 {Resilience denotes the capacity of a system to withstand shocks and its ability to
                  recover from them.  We develop a framework to quantify the resilience of highly
                  volatile, non-equilibrium social organizations, such as collectives or
                  collaborating teams.  It consists of four steps: (i) \emph{delimitation}, i.e.,
                  narrowing down the target systems, (ii) \emph{conceptualization}, i.e.,
                  identifying how to approach social organizations, (iii) formal
                  \emph{representation} using a combination of agent-based and network models, (iv)
                  \emph{operationalization}, i.e. specifying measures and demonstrating how they
                  enter the calculation of resilience.  Our framework quantifies two dimensions of
                  resilience, the \emph{robustness} of social organizations and their
                  \emph{adaptivity}, and combines them in a novel resilience measure.  It allows
                  monitoring resilience instantaneously using longitudinal data instead of an
                  ex-post evaluation.  }
