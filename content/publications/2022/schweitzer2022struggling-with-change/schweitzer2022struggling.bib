  abstract = {Collectives form non-equilibrium social structures characterised
    by a volatile dynamics. Individuals join or leave. Social relations change
    quickly. Therefore, differently from engineered or ecological systems, a
    resilient reference state cannot be defined. We propose a novel resilience
    measure combining two dimensions: robustness and adaptivity. We demonstrate
    how they can be quantified using data from a software developer collective.
    Our analysis reveals a resilience life cycle, i.e., stages of increasing
    resilience are followed by stages of decreasing resilience. We explain the
    reasons for these observed dynamics and provide a formal model to reproduce
    them. The resilience life cycle allows distinguishing between short-term
    resilience, given by a sequence of resilient states, and long-term
    resilience, which requires collectives to survive through different cycles.},
