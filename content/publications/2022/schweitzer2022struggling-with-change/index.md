abstract: 'Collectives form non-equilibrium social structures characterised by a volatile
  dynamics. Individuals join or leave. Social relations change quickly. Therefore,
  differently from engineered or ecological systems, a resilient reference state cannot
  be defined. We propose a novel resilience measure combining two dimensions: robustness
  and adaptivity. We demonstrate how they can be quantified using data from a software
  developer collective. Our analysis reveals a resilience life cycle, i.e., stages
  of increasing resilience are followed by stages of decreasing resilience. We explain
  the reasons for these observed dynamics and provide a formal model to reproduce
  them. The resilience life cycle allows distinguishing between short-term resilience,
  given by a sequence of resilient states, and long-term resilience, which requires
  collectives to survive through different cycles.'
