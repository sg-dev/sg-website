abstract: This paper develops a simulation model of the behavior of industrial districts
  in the face of changes in their environment. By applying Kauffman's N/K-C model
  to the question of optimum governance in industrial districts facing an external
  shock, the paper sheds light on the optimum co-ordination mechanism among agents
  in interdependent industrial networks. Simulation results indicate that collective
  governance structures with agents adjusting for the sake of the district as a whole
  perform best in adaptation, whereas individualistic governance modes deliver the
  worst results. Alliance and leader firm governance forms position themselves in-between
  these two extremes. However, both modes of governance can be preferable to the collective
  one if the observation and punishment mechanisms in the district's local culture
  are not strong enough to impose solidarity among its agents. In this case, a prisoner's
  dilemma emerges and the collective governance form is replaced by the inferior individualistic
  one. Through these results, the model highlights the link between governance and
  district adaptability. It provides an explanation for the trend in Italian districts
  towards more hierarchical governance structures. Moreover, the identification of
  the role played by governance structure for district adaptability in changing environments
  could serve as guidance for future research.
