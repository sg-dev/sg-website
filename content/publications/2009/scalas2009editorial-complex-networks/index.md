abstract: This topical issue features regular submissions to Advances in Complex Systems
  focusing on ‘Complex Networks’ from diﬀerent perspectives. They have been selected
  by the editors to appear together in this issue, to highlight current research trends.‘Complex
  Networks’ is a booming research area for quite a few years now. Since the work of
  Watts and Strogatz on ‘small world networks’ published in 1998 (a paper for which
  Google Scholar lists 7417 citations as of 14th February 2009), a networkmania has
  exploded in many applied ﬁelds of science. This led to the rediscovery of various
  results already present in the mathematical literature on graphs. However, the increasing
  interest on networks also led to the rediscovery of some gems in sociology, including
  the work of Granovetter on social networks already published in 1973.Today, research
  on complex networks has expanded to various branches of science, ranging from biology
  to transportation, from economics to linguistics. Hence, it is becoming a truly
  interdisciplinary endeavor. It is worth noticing that the research in these areas
  is increasingly driven by available data, in addition to extending theoretical concepts
  to characterize these networks.
