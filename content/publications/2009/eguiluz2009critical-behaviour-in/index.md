abstract: Experimental studies have shown the ubiquity of altruistic behavior in human
  societies. The social structure is a fundamental ingredient to understand the degree
  of altruism displayed by the members of a society, in contrast to individual-based
  features, like for example age or gender, which have been shown not to be relevant
  to determine the level of altruistic behavior. We explore an evolutionary model
  aiming to delve how altruistic behavior is affected by social structure. We investigate
  the dynamics of interacting individuals playing the Ultimatum Game with their neighbors
  given by a social network of interaction. We show that a population self-organizes
  in a critical state where the degree of altruism depends on the topology characterizing
  the social structure. In general, individuals offering large shares but in turn
  accepting large shares, are removed from the population. In heterogeneous social
  networks, individuals offering intermediate shares are strongly selected in contrast
  to random homogeneous networks where a broad range of offers, below a critical one,
  is similarly present in the population.
