abstract: "A local culture denotes a commonly shared behaviour within a cluster of\
  \ firms. Similar to social norms or conventions, it is an emergent feature resulting\
  \ from the firms' interaction in an economic network. To model these dynamics, we\
  \ consider a distributed agent population, representing e.g. firms or individuals.\
  \ Further, we build on a continuous opinion dynamics model with bounded confidence\
  \ ($ epsilon$), which assumes that two agents only interact if differences in their\
  \ behaviour are less than $ epsilon$. Interaction results in more similarity of\
  \ behaviour, i.e. convergence towards a common mean. This framework is extended\
  \ by two major concepts: (i) The agent's in-group consisting of acquainted interaction\
  \ partners is explicitly taken into account. This leads to an effective agent behaviour\
  \ reflecting that agents try to continue to interact with past partners and thus\
  \ to keep sufficiently close to them. (ii) The in-group network structure changes\
  \ over time, as agents can form new links to other agents with sufficiently close\
  \ effective behaviour or delete links to agents no longer close in behaviour. Thus,\
  \ our model provides a feedback mechanism between the agents' behaviour and their\
  \ in-group structure. Studying its consequences by means of agent-based computer\
  \ simulations, we find that for narrow-minded agents (low $ epsilon$) the additional\
  \ feedback helps to find consensus more often, whereas for open-minded agents (high\
  \ $ epsilon$) this does not hold. This counterintuitive result is explained by simulations\
  \ of the network evolution."
