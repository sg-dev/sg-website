abstract: We present a methodology to extract the backbone of complex networks based
  on the weight and direction of links, as well as on non-topological properties of
  nodes. We show how the methodology can be applied in general to networks in which
  mass or energy is flowing along the links. In particular, the procedure enables
  us to address important questions in economics, namely, how control and wealth are
  structured and concentrated across national markets. We report on the first cross-country
  investigation of ownership networks, focusing on the stock markets of 48 countries
  around the world. On the one hand, our analysis confirms results expected on the
  basis of the literature on corporate control, namely, that in Anglo-Saxon countries
  control tends to be dispersed among numerous shareholders. On the other hand, it
  also reveals that in the same countries, control is found to be highly concentrated
  at the global level, namely, lying in the hands of very few important shareholders.
  Interestingly, the exact opposite is observed for European countries. These results
  have previously not been reported as they are not observable without the kind of
  network analysis developed here.
