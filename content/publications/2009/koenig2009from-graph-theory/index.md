abstract: Networks play an important role in a wide range of economic phenomena. Despite
  this fact, standard economic theory rarely considers economic networks explicitly
  in its analysis. However, a major innovation in economic theory has been the use
  of methods stemming from graph theory to describe and study relations between economic
  agents in networks. This recent development has lead to a fast increase in theoretical
  research on economic networks. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to some
  basic concepts used in a wide range of models of economic networks.
