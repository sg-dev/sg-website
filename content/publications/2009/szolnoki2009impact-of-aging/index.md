abstract: Aging is always present, tailoring our interactions with others, and postulating
  a finite lifespan during which we are able to exercise them. We consider the prisoner’s
  dilemma game on a square lattice and examine how quenched age distributions and
  different aging protocols influence the evolution of cooperation when taking the
  life experience and knowledge accumulation into account as time passes. In agreement
  with previous studies, we find that a quenched assignment of age to players, introducing
  heterogeneity to the game, substantially promotes cooperative behavior. Introduction
  of aging and subsequent death as a coevolutionary process may act detrimental on
  cooperation but enhances it efficiently if the offspring of individuals that have
  successfully passed their strategy is considered newborn. We study resulting age
  distributions of players and show that the heterogeneity is vital—yet insufficient—for
  explaining the observed differences in cooperator abundance on the spatial grid.
  The unexpected increment of cooperation levels can be explained by a dynamical effect
  that has a highly selective impact on the propagation of cooperator and defector
  states.
