abstract: The current economic crisis illustrates a critical need for new and fundamental
  understanding of the structure and dynamics of economic networks. Economic systems
  are increasingly built on interdependencies, implemented through trans-national
  credit and investment networks, trade relations, or supply chains that have proven
  difficult to predict and control. We need, therefore, an approach that stresses
  the systemic complexity of economic networks and that can be used to revise and
  extend established paradigms in economic theory. This will facilitate the design
  of policies that reduce conflicts between individual interests and global efficiency,
  as well as reduce the risk of global failure by making economic networks more robust.
