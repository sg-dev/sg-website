abstract: In this paper histograms of user ratings for movies (1,...,10) are analysed.
  The evolving stabilised shapes of histograms follow the rule that all are either
  double - or triple - peaked. Moreover, at most one peak can be on the central bins
  2,...,9 and the distribution in these bins looks smooth `Gaussian - like’ while
  changes at the extremes (1 and 10) often look abrupt. It is shown that this is well
  approximated under the assumption that histograms are confined and discretised probability
  density functions of L'evy skew $α$ - stable distributions. These distributions
  are the only stable distributions which could emerge due to a generalized central
  limit theorem from averaging of various independent random variables as which one
  can see the initial opinions of users. Averaging is also an appropriate assumption
  about the social process which underlies the process of continuous opinion formation.
  Surprisingly, not the normal distribution achieves the best fit over histograms
  observed on the web, but distributions with fat tails which decay as power - laws
  with exponent –(1 + $α$) . The scale and skewness parameters of the L'evy skew $α$
  - stable distributions seem to depend on the deviation from an average movie (with
  mean about 7.6). The histogram of such an average movie has no skewness and is the
  most narrow one. If a movie deviates from average the distribution gets broader
  and skew. The skewness pronounces the deviation. This is used to construct a one
  parameter fit which gives some evidence of universality in processes of continuous
  opinion dynamics about taste.
