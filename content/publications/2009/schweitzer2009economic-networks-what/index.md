abstract: We examine the emergent field of economic networks and explore its ability
  to shed light on the global and volatile economy where credit, ownership, innovation,
  invest - ment, and virtually every other economic activity is carried at a scale
  and scope that respects no geographical, organizational, or political boundaries.
  In this context, the study of economic networks and their dynamics must reflect
  the vast complexity of the interaction patterns and integrate it with a realistic
  account of the incentives and information that govern agentsâ€™ behavior. The interplay
  of both has been shown to pro - duce metastabilities, system crashes, and emergent
  structures in ways that are yet only poorly understood. Meeting this exciting scientific
  challenge requires a combination of time - series analysis, complexity theory, and
  simulation with the analytical tools that have been developed by game theory, as
  well as graph and matrix theories. We argue that this will help achieving a better
  integration of theory and data models and provide a better understanding of the
  potentials and risks of modern economic systems.
