abstract: We study an opinion formation model that takes into account that individuals
  have diverse preferences when forming their opinion regarding a particular issue.
  We show that the system exhibits a phenomenon called \"diversity-induced resonance\"[Tessone
  et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 194101 (2006)], by which an external influence (for
  example advertising, or fashion trends) is better followed by populations having
  the right degree of diversity in their preferences, rather than others where the
  individuals are identical or have too different preferences. We support our findings
  by numerical simulations of the model and a mean-field type analytical theory.
