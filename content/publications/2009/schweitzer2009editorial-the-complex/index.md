abstract: EPJ B now receives more than 1000 submissions per year, and accounting for
  almost half of these, the ‘Complex Systems’ section has become popular to a degree
  where we are proud to oﬀer you for the ﬁrst time a regular issue of the journal
  containing original papers only from this area. They were not specially submitted
  for this issue, but instead were all recently accepted and selected from among our
  growing set of regular submissions from the ﬁelds of statistical, nonlinear and
  interdisciplinary physics.
