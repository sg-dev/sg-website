abstract: We propose a novel trust metric for social networks which is suitable for
  application in recommender systems. It is personalised and dynamic and allows to
  compute the indirect trust between two agents which are not neighbours based on
  the direct trust between agents that are neighbours. In analogy to some personalised
  versions of PageRank, this metric makes use of the concept of feedback centrality
  and overcomes some of the limitations of other trust metrics.In particular, it does
  not neglect cycles and other patterns characterising social networks, as some other
  algorithms do. In order to apply the metric to recommender systems, we propose a
  way to make trust dynamic over time. We show by means of analytical approximations
  and computer simulations that the metric has the desired properties. Finally, we
  carry out an empirical validation on a dataset crawled from an Internet community
  and compare the performance of a recommender system using our metric to one using
  collaborative filtering.
