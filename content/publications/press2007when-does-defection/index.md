abstract: The present paper investigates cluster adjustment to changing economic environments
  by focussing on the role and stability of institutional arrangements in their local
  culture. It postulates two idealtypical local cultures where firms act in the common
  (collective) or in their own interest (egoistic). By comparing adjustment performance
  and stability for both types, the model finds that clusters in very volatile environments
  are unlikely to exhibit collective local cultures as these are unstable and provide
  only limited benefits for adjustment performance. Clusters facing more stable environments
  are more likely to show collective local cultures as these increase adjustment performance
  and are more stable against individual defection. Both findings suggest that collective
  local cultures in clusters can be relatively stable for limited environment volatility.
