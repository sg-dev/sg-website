abstract: We explore the nonlinear dynamics of a macroeconomic model with resource
  constraints. The dynamics is derived from a production function that considers capital
  and a generalized  form of energy as inputs. Energy, the new variable, is depleted
  during the production process and has to be renewed, whereas capital grows with
  production and decreases from depreciation. Dependent on time scales and energy
  related control parameters, we obtain  steady states of high or low production,
  but also sustained oscillations that show properties of business cycles. We also
  find conditions for the coexistence of stable fixed points and limit cycles. Our
  model allows to specify investment and saving functions for Kaldor's model of business
  cycles. We provide evidence for an endogenous origin of business cycles if depleting
  resources are taken into account.
