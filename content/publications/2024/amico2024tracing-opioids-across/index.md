abstract: ' In the field of pharmaceutical supply chains, there is a lack of comprehensive
  historical data, representing a significant barrier to advancing research. To address
  this gap, we introduce a high-resolution dataset comprising drug packages distributed
  to approximately 300,000 pharmacies, hospitals, and practitioners across the US.
  We reconstruct 375 million distribution paths from ARCOS, a DEA-maintained database
  comprising half a billion shipping records between 2006 and 2014. While ARCOS tracks
  dyadic shipments, it does not provide information on the complete journey of single
  packages from manufacturers to final destinations. Our algorithm is able to reconstruct
  complete distribution paths from these dyadic records. The reconstructed dataset,
  with its high temporal and spatial resolution, offers an unprecedented view of US
  pharmaceutical distribution and is a valuable resource for investigating supply
  and distribution networks. '
