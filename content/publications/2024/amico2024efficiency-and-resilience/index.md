abstract: 'Networks to distribute goods, from raw materials to food and medicines,
  are the backbone of a functioning economy. They are shaped by several supply relations
  connecting manufacturers, distributors, and ﬁnal buyers worldwide. We present a
  network-based model to describe the mechanisms underlying the emergence and growth
  of distribution networks. In our model, ﬁrms consider two practices when establishing
  new supply relations: centralization, the tendency to choose highly connected partners,
  and multi-sourcing, the preference for multiple suppliers. Centralization enhances
  network eﬃciency by leveraging short distribution paths; multi-sourcing fosters
  resilience by providing multiple distribution paths connecting ﬁnal buyers to the
  manufacturer. We validate the proposed model using data on drug shipments in the
  US. Drawing on these data, we reconstruct 22 nationwide pharmaceutical distribution
  networks. We demonstrate that the proposed model successfully replicates several
  structural features of the empirical networks, including their out-degree and path
  length distributions as well as their resilience and eﬃciency properties. These
  ﬁndings suggest that the proposed ﬁrm-level practices eﬀectively capture the network
  growth process that leads to the observed structures.'
