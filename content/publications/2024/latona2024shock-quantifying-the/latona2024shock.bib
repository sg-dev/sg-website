	abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) projects play a critical role in the
digital infrastructure of companies and services provided to millions
of people. Given their importance, understanding the resilience
of OSS projects is paramount. A primary reason for OSS project
failure is the shock caused by the dropout of a core developer,
which can jeopardize productivity and project survival. Using a
difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis, this study investigates the
repercussions of this shock on the productivity of 8,234 developers
identified among 9,573 OSS GitHub projects. Our findings reveal
the indirect impact of the core developer’s dropout. The remaining
developers experienced a 20% productivity drop. This observation
is troubling because it suggests that the shock might push other
developers to drop out, putting the collaboration structure of the
project at risk. Also, projects with higher productivity before the
shock experienced a larger drop-down after the shock. This points
to a tradeoff between productivity and resilience, i.e., the ability
of OSS projects to recover from the dropout of a core developer.
Our findings underscore the importance of a balanced approach
in OSS project management, harmonizing productivity goals with
resilience considerations.},
