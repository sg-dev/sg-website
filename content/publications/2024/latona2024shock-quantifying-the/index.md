abstract: Open Source Software (OSS) projects play a critical role in the digital
  infrastructure of companies and services provided to millions of people. Given their
  importance, understanding the resilience of OSS projects is paramount. A primary
  reason for OSS project failure is the shock caused by the dropout of a core developer,
  which can jeopardize productivity and project survival. Using a difference-in-differences
  (DiD) analysis, this study investigates the repercussions of this shock on the productivity
  of 8,234 developers identified among 9,573 OSS GitHub projects. Our findings reveal
  the indirect impact of the core developer’s dropout. The remaining developers experienced
  a 20% productivity drop. This observation is troubling because it suggests that
  the shock might push other developers to drop out, putting the collaboration structure
  of the project at risk. Also, projects with higher productivity before the shock
  experienced a larger drop-down after the shock. This points to a tradeoff between
  productivity and resilience, i.e., the ability of OSS projects to recover from the
  dropout of a core developer. Our findings underscore the importance of a balanced
  approach in OSS project management, harmonizing productivity goals with resilience
  considerations.
