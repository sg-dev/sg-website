abstract: We consider a dynamic model of network formation where agents form and sever
  links based on the centrality of their potential partners.We show that the existence
  of capacity constrains in the amount of links an agent can maintain introduces a
  transition from dissortative to assortative networks. This effect can shed light
  on the distinction between technological and social networks as it gives a simple
  mechanism explaining how and why this transition occurs.
