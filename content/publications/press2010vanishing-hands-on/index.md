abstract: The present article investigates whether modular product architectures deliver
  better and more differentiated products, given their production in disintegrated
  and integrated settings. A theoretic model benchmarks the performance of disin -
  tegration and integration for different degrees of product modularity by measur
  - ing both product quality and differentiation. In line with conventional wisdom,
  (nearly) modular products befit disintegration insofar as disintegration increases
  quality. However, disintegration only leads to greater product differentiation than
  integration if there is substantial entry and exit. These findings—albeit developed
  with stylised models of disintegration and integration—provide a possible explan
  - ation for empirical results showing a decrease in product variety when modular
  products were produced by independent manufacturers (disintegration). Moreover,
  the model results predict that industries with limited entry and exit as well as
  strong winner - take - all dynamics tend to incur a loss in variety if modular products
  are produced in a disintegrated setting.
