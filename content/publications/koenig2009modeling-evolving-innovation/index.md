abstract: We develop a new framework for modeling innovation networks which evolve
  over time. The nodes in the network represent firms, whereas the directed links
  represent unilateral interactions between the firms. Both nodes and links evolve
  according to their own dynamics and on different time scales. The model assumes
  that firms produce knowledge based on the knowledge exchange with other firms, which
  involves both costs and benefits for the participating firms. In order to increase
  their knowledge production, firms follow different strategies to create and/or to
  delete links with other firms. Dependent on the information firms take into account
  for their decision, we find the emergence of different network structures. We analyze
  the conditions for the existence of these structures within a mathematical approach
  and underpin our findings by extensive computer simulations which show the evolution
  of the networks and their equilibrium state. In the discussion of the results, particular
  attention is given to the emergence of direct and indirect reciprocity in knowledge
  exchange, which refers to the emergence of cycles in the network structure. In order
  to motivate our modeling framework, in the first part of the chapter we give a broad
  overview of existing literature from economics and physics. This shows that our
  framework bridges and extends two different lines of research, namely the study
  of equilibrium networks with simple topologies and the dynamic approach of hypercycle
  models.
