abstract: In this paper we study changes in the size and the composition of the labour
  force in five selected OECD countries from 1983 through 2000. We apply a recent
  decomposition method to quantify the components of the change over time in the crude
  labour force rate and the mean age of the labour force. Our results show that the
  change in the crude labour force rate was dominated by the change in age-specific
  labour force participation rates. For the mean age of the labour force we find that
  for males the change in the age composition of the population predominately explains
  the overall change while the results for females are less clear-cut.
