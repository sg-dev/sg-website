abstract: Noise - induced volatility refers to a phenomenon of increased level of
  fluctuations in the collective dynamics of bistable units in the presence of a rapidly
  varying external signal, and intermediate noise levels. The archetypical signature
  of this phenomenon is that –beyond the increase in the level of fluctuations– the
  response of the system becomes uncorrelated with the external driving force, making
  it different from stochastic resonance. Numerical simulations and an analytical
  theory of a stochastic dynamical version of the Ising model on regular and random
  networks demonstrate the ubiquity and robustness of this phenomenon, which is argued
  to be a possible cause of excess volatility in financial markets, of enhanced effective
  temperatures in a variety of out - of - equilibriumsystems and of strong selective
  responses of immune systems of complex biological organisms. Extensive nu - merical
  simulations are compared with a mean - field theory for different network topologies.
