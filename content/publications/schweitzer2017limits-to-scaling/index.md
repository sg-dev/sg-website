abstract: 'In engineering, the term \"scaling\" may be used to describe a relation
  between objects and their models. In the exact sciences, however, scaling is a systemic
  property, i.e. it relates to the system itself and not to our perception of it.
  Scaling describes how certain system properties change conditional on others, most
  notably the system size.  Certain systems are characterized by a natural scale which
  remains constant even if the system size increases. Such systems are often described
  by the so-called normal distribution and are very predictable with respect to that
  scale, or quantity.   Other systems are scale-free in the sense that no characteristic
  scale exists. Such systems are characterised by very broad distributions. This means
  everything can happen with a non-negligible probability.   Such considerations imply
  that the system properties do not change with scale other than the way defined by
  the distributions. But complex systems, i.e. systems consisting of a large number
  of interacting elements (usually denoted as agents), also have the property of emergence.
  This describes the sudden occurrence of new system qualities once certain critical
  parameters are reached. This means, above a certain system size the system behaves
  completely different. Sometimes, it is very difficult to predict when this critical
  size is reached.   Most real complex systems are characterized both by emergent
  properties and by scaling laws that do not simply follow a power-law behavior.  Economic
  systems, for example, are often described by decreasing returns to scale.  Conclusion:
  there are several limits to scaling: (i) natural scales, which are system immanent,
  (ii) critical parameters at which system properties change in a discontinuous manner,
  i.e. new system qualities emerge, (iii) decreasing returns to scale, which render
  any further growth unprofitable.'
