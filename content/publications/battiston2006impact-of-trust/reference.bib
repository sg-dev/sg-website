    abstract = "Social agents naturally use their social and professional networks to filter information
by trustworthiness. In this paper, we present a model of an automated distributed recom-
mendation system on a social network and we investigate how the dynamics of trust among
agents affect the performance of the system. Agents search their social network for recom-
mendations on items to be consumed and the propagation of the query through agents at
several degrees of separation enhances the efficiency of their search. Moreover, agents have
heterogeneous preferences so that trust between neighbours can be used to filter information
coming from remote agents. We identify the range of the density of the network and the
degree of heterogeneity of agent preferences in which trust improves the performance of the
recommendation system.
