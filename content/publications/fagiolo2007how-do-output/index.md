abstract: This paper investigates the statistical properties of within-country gross
  domestic product (GDP) and industrial production (IP) growth-rate distributions.
  Many empirical contributions have re-cently pointed out that cross-section growth
  rates of firms, industries and countries all follow Laplace distributions. In this
  work, we test whether also within-country, time-series GDP and IP growth rates can
  be approximated by tent-shaped distributions. We fit output growth rates with the
  exponential-power (Subbotin) family of densities, which includes as particular cases
  both Gaussian and Laplace distributions. We find that, for a large number of OECD
  (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries including the
  US, both GDP and IP growth rates are Laplace distributed. Moreover, we show that
  fat-tailed distributions robustly emerge even after controlling for outliers, autocorrelation
  and het-eroscedasticity.
