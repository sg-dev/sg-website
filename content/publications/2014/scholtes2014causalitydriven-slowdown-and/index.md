abstract: Recent research has highlighted limitations of studying complex systems
  with time-varying topologies from the perspective of static, time-aggregated networks.
  Non-Markovian characteristics resulting from the ordering of interactions in temporal
  networks were identified as one important mechanism that alters causality and affects
  dynamical processes. So far, an analytical explanation for this phenomenon and for
  the significant variations observed across different systems is missing. Here we
  introduce a methodology that allows to analytically predict causality-driven changes
  of diffusion speed in non-Markovian temporal networks. Validating our predictions
  in six data sets we show that compared with the time-aggregated network, non-Markovian
  characteristics can lead to both a slow-down or speed-up of diffusion, which can
  even outweigh the decelerating effect of community structures in the static topology.
  Thus, non-Markovian properties of temporal networks constitute an important additional
  dimension of complexity in time-varying complex systems.
