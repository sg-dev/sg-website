abstract: We combine user-centric Twitter data with video-centric YouTube data to
  analyze who watches and shares what on YouTube. Combination of two data sets, with
  87k Twitter users, 5.6mln YouTube videos and 15mln video sharing events, allows
  rich analysis going beyond what could be obtained with either of the two data sets
  individually. For Twitter, we generate user features relating to activity, interests
  and demographics. For YouTube, we obtain video features for topic, popularity and
  polarization. These two feature sets are combined through sharing events for YouTube
  URLs on Twitter. This combination is done both in a user-, a video-and a sharing-event-centric
  manner. For the user-centric analysis, we show how Twitter user features correlate
  both with YouTube features and with sharing-related features. As two examples, we
  show urban users are quicker to share than rural users and for some notions of \"influence\"
  influential users on Twitter share videos with a higher number of views. For the
  video-centric analysis, we find a superlinear relation between initial Twitter shares
  and the final amounts of views, showing the correlated behavior of Twitter. On user
  impact, we find the total amount of followers of users that shared the video in
  the first week does not affect its final popularity. However, aggregated user retweet
  rates serve as a better predictor for YouTube video popularity. For the sharing-centric
  analysis, we reveal existence of correlated behavior concerning the time between
  video creation and sharing within certain timescales, showing the time onset for
  a coherent response, and the time limit after which collective responses are extremely
  unlikely. We show that response times depend on video category, revealing that Twitter
  sharing of a video is highly dependent on its content. To the best of our knowledge
  this is the first large-scale study combining YouTube and Twitter data.
