abstract: Every day, millions of Internet users leave online traces that are publicly
  accessible. Data about forum comments, video downloads, or product reviews provide
  a valuable insight into human online behavior. The retrieval of datasets of unprecedented
  size may eventu- ally also allow testing of hypotheses or validation of theories
  that have been developed in the social sciences, for example, about preferences,
  social influence (Lorenz, 2009; Onnela & Reed-Tsochas, 2010), trust, and cooperation
  (Walter, Battiston, Yildirim, & Schweitzer, 2011). This recent scientific development
  has led to the emerging field of computational social science (Lazer et al., 2009)
  which combines methods and tools from different tech- nical and social disciplines.
  Also, psychology can benefit from this development by get- ting access to data without
  designing expensive experimental setups of limited size. For example, the analysis
  of Twitter messages allows studying the influence of the circadian cycles on human
  mood (Golder & Macy, 2011), and sentiment analysis of large-scale datasets reveals
  patterns of emotional expression predicted by earlier theories (Garcia, Garas, &
  Schweitzer, 2012).
