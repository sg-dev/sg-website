abstract: The measurement of information flows within moving animal groups has recently
  been a topic of considerable interest, and it has become clear that the individual(s)
  that drive collective movement may change over time, and that such individuals may
  not necessarily always lead from the front. However, methods to quantify the influence
  of specific individuals on the behaviour of other group members and the direction
  of information flow in moving group, are lacking on the level of empirical studies
  and theoretical models. Using high spatio-temporal resolution GPS trajectories of
  foraging meerkats, Suricata suricatta, we provide an information-theoretic framework
  to identify dynamical coupling between animals independent of their relative spatial
  positions. Based on this identification, we then compare designations of individuals
  as either drivers or responders against designations provided by the relative spatial
  position. We find that not only does coupling occur both from the frontal to the
  trailing individuals and vice versa, but also that the coupling direction is a non-linear
  function of the relative position. This provides evidence for (i) intermittent fluctuation
  of the coupling strength and (ii) alternation in the coupling direction within foraging
  meerkat pairs. The framework we introduce allows for a detailed description of the
  dynamical patterns of mutual influence between all pairs of individuals within moving
  animal groups. We argue that applying an information-theoretic perspective to the
  study of coordinated phenomena in animal groups will eventually help to understand
  cause and effect in collective behaviour.
