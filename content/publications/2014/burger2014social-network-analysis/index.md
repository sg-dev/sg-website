abstract: Enterprise social software tools are increasingly being used to support
  the communication and collaboration between employees, as well as to facilitate
  the collaborative organisation of information and knowledge within companies. Not
  only do these tools help to develop and maintain an efficient social organisation,
  they also produce massive amounts of fine-grained data on collaborations, communication
  and other forms of social relationships within an enterprise. In this chapter, we
  argue that the availability of these data provides unique opportunities to monitor
  and analyse social structures and their impact on the success and performance of
  individuals, teams, communities and organisations. We further review methods from
  the planning, design and optimisation of telecommunication networks and discuss
  challenges arising when wanting to apply them to optimise the structure of enterprise
  social networks.
