abstract: We develop an agent-based model of strategic link formation in Research
  and Development (R&D) networks. Empirical evidence has shown that the growth of
  these networks is driven by mechanisms which are both endogenous to the system (that
  is, depending on existing alliances patterns) and exogenous (that is, driven by
  an exploratory search for newcomer firms). Extant research to date has not investigated
  both mechanisms simultaneously in a comparative manner. To overcome this limitation,
  we develop a general modeling framework to shed light on the relative importance
  of these two mechanisms. We test our model against a comprehensive dataset, listing
  cross-country and cross-sectoral R&D alliances from 1984 to 2009. Our results show
  that by fitting only three macroscopic properties of the network topology, this
  framework is able to reproduce a number of micro-level measures, including the distributions
  of degree, local clustering, path length and component size, and the emergence of
  network clusters. Furthermore, by estimating the link probabilities towards newcomers
  and established firms from the data, we find that endogenous mechanisms are predominant
  over the exogenous ones in the network formation, thus quantifying the importance
  of existing structures in selecting partner firms.
