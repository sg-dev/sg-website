abstract: Among species providing uniparental care, the caring parent faces time constraints
  and may have to compromise offspring care/protection for self-maintenance. In most
  mammalian species females raise their offspring without receiving help from males.
  Communal nesting, when multiple females share a single nest where they rear their
  pups together, may have evolved as a mutually beneficial cooperative behaviour to
  reduce mothers' nest attendance without increasing the time their offspring are
  left alone. We tested this hypothesis using data collected in a free-living house
  mouse population where reproduction occurred in nest boxes and was closely monitored.
  Individuals were fitted with transponders allowing automatic recording of their
  location, and a genetic parentage analysis confirmed maternal identity. Compared
  to mothers raising their pups solitarily, communally nesting mothers spent less
  time inside their nest. Their pups, however, were left alone for a similar amount
  of time as solitarily raised pups. The time communal litters were left alone did
  not covary with the kinship of communally nesting females. These results indicate
  that communally nesting mothers can allocate more time to foraging or territorial
  defence without impairing the amount of maternal attention received by their offspring.
  Nevertheless, communally nesting mothers showed some overlap in their stays at the
  nest. Offspring may benefit from more regular meals while mothers may gain information
  on the partner's contribution to combined maternal care which could potentially
  prevent cheating.
