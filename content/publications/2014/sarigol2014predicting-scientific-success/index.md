abstract: We address the question to what extent the success of scientific articles
  is due to social influence. Analyzing a data set of over 100000 publications from
  the field of Computer Science, we study how centrality in the coauthorship network
  differs between authors who have highly cited papers and those who do not. We further
  show that a machine learning classifier, based only on coauthorship network centrality
  measures at time of publication, is able to predict with high precision whether
  an article will be highly cited five years after publication. By this we provide
  quantitative insight into the social dimension of scientific publishing - challenging
  the perception of citations as an objective, socially unbiased measure of scientific
  success.
