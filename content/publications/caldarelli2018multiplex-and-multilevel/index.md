abstract: Multiplex and Multilayer Networks is a collection of some of the results
  obtained in the new field of complex networks theory with respect to multilevel,
  multiplex, and interacting networks. The ever-increasing availability of data in
  fields ranging from computer science to urban systems, medicine, economics, and
  finance shows that networks that were usually perceived as distinct and isolated
  are, in reality, interacting with other networks. While this sounds like a trivial
  observation, the interactions in multilevel complex networks can lead to unexpected
  behaviors and allow systemic vulnerabilities to emerge. The research activities
  of many different laboratories and groups in this field have been financed by the
  EU MULTIPLEX project (http://www.multiplexproject.eu). This project utilized 23
  distinct research teams across Europe and, from 2012 to 2016, explored this new
  area of research. The results, presented in this volume, range from the theory of
  static multinetworks to dynamical process on them, to their percolating properties,
  and, finally, to applications in the case of social systems.
