abstract: Sentiment analysis programs are now sometimes used to detect patterns of
  sentiment use over time in online communication and to help automated systems interact
  better with users. Nevertheless, it seems that no previouspublished study has assessed
  whether the position of individual texts within ongoing communication can be exploited
  to help detect their sentiments. This article assesses apparent sentiment anomalies
  in on - going communication – textsassigned significantly different sentiment strength
  to the average of previoustexts – to see whether their classification can be improved.
  The results suggestthat a damping procedure to reduce sudden large changes in sentiment
  can improve classification accuracy but that the optimal procedure will depend on
  thetype of texts processed.
