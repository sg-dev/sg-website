abstract: "The recent crisis has brought to the fore a crucial question that remains\
  \ still open: what would be the optimal architecture of financial systems? We investigate\
  \ the stability of several benchmark topologies in a simple default cascading dynamics\
  \ in bank networks. We analyze the interplay of several crucial drivers, i.e., network\
  \ topology, banks' capital ratios, market illiquidity, and random vs targeted shocks.\
  \ We find that, in general, topology matters only – but substantially – when the\
  \ market is illiquid. No single topology is always superior to others. In particular,\
  \ scale - free networks can be both more robust and more fragile than homogeneous\
  \ architectures. This finding has important policy implications. We also apply our\
  \ methodology to a comprehensive dataset of an interbank market from 1999 to 2011."
