abstract: We analyse time series of CDS spreads for a set of major US and European
  institutions in a period overlapping the recent financial crisis. We extend the
  existing methodology of epsilon-drawdowns to the one of joint epsilon-drawups, in
  order to estimate the conditional probabilities of spike-like co-movements among
  pairs of spreads. After correcting for randomness and finite size effects, we find
  that, depending on the period of time, 50% of the pairs or more exhibit high probabilities
  of joint drawups and the majority of spread series are trend-reinforced, i.e. drawups
  tend to be followed by drawups in the same series. We then carry out a network analysis
  by taking the probability of joint drawups as a proxy of financial dependencies
  among institutions. We introduce two novel centrality-like measures that offer insights
  on how both the systemic impact of each node as well as its vulnerability to other
  nodes' shocks evolve in time.
