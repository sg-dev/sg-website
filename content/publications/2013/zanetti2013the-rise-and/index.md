abstract: Social organization and division of labor crucially influence the performance
  of collaborative software engineering efforts. In this paper, we provide a quantitative
  analysis of the relation between social organization and performance in Gentoo,
  an Open Source community developing a Linux distribution. We study the structure
  and dynamics of collaborations as recorded in the project's bug tracking system
  over a period of ten years. We identify a period of increasing centralization after
  which most interactions in the community were mediated by a single central contributor.
  In this period of maximum centralization, the central contributor unexpectedly left
  the project, thus posing a significant challenge for the community. We quantify
  how the rise, the activity as well as the subsequent sudden dropout of this central
  contributor affected both the social organization and the bug handling performance
  of the Gentoo community. We analyze social organization from the perspective of
  network theory and augment our quantitative findings by interviews with prominent
  members of the Gentoo community which shared their personal insights.
