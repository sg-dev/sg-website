abstract: The goal of human resource management is to ensure an effective company
  environment. Crucial for a good corporate culture is a comfortable atmosphere and
  positive social relationships between the employees. The interactions of the people
  and groups working in the company define their relationships and are reflected in
  the company's social network. Projections of such networks are Enterprise Social
  Networks which are more and more integrated in companies. These social networks
  can be a powerful tool to analyse the structure of a company and indicate potential
  problems. This extended abstract poses research questions to identify and quantify
  mechanisms that have an impact on the social network of a company to ensure resilience.
  To address these questions we make assumptions based on real-world observations
  for a subsequent model.
