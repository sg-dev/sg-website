abstract: External or internal shocks may lead to the collapse of a system consisting
  of many agents. If the shock hits only one agent initially and causes it to fail,
  this can induce a cascade of failures among neighoring agents. Several critical
  constellations determine whether this cascade remains finite or reaches the size
  of the system, i.e. leads to systemic risk. We investigate the critical parameters
  for such cascades in a simple model, where agents are characterized by an individual
  threshold $$theta_i determining their capacity to handle a load $$alpha$$theta_i
  with 1-$$alpha being their safety margin. If agents fail, they redistribute their
  load equally to K neighboring agents in a regular network. For three different threshold
  distributions P($$theta), we derive analytical results for the size of the cascade,
  X(t), which is regarded as a measure of systemic risk, and the time when it stops.
  We focus on two different regimes, (i) EEE, an external extreme event where the
  size of the shock is of the order of the total capacity of the network, and (ii)
  RIE, a random internal event where the size of the shock is of the order of the
  capacity of an agent. We find that even for large extreme events that exceed the
  capacity of the network finite cascades are still possible, if a power-law threshold
  distribution is assumed. On the other hand, even small random fluctuations may lead
  to full cascades if critical conditions are met. Most importantly, we demonstrate
  that the size of the \"big\" shock is not the problem, as the systemic risk only
  varies slightly for changes of 10 to 50 percent of the external shock. Systemic
  risk depends much more on ingredients such as the network topology, the safety margin
  and the threshold distribution, which gives hints on how to reduce systemic risk.
