abstract: In this paper we focus on diversity-induced resonance, which was recently
  found in bistable, excitable, and other physical systems. We study the appearance
  of this phenomenon in a purely economic model of cooperating and defecting agents.
  An agent's contribution to a public good is seen as a social norm, so defecting
  agents face a social pressure, which decreases if free riding becomes widespread.
  In this model, diversity among agents naturally appears because of the different
  sensitivities towards the social norm. We study the evolution of cooperation as
  a response to the social norm (i) for the replicator dynamics and (ii) for the logit
  dynamics by means of numerical simulations. Diversity-induced resonance is observed
  as a maximum in the response of agents to changes in the social norm as a function
  of the degree of heterogeneity in the population. We provide an analytical, mean-field
  approach for the logit dynamics and find very good agreement with the simulations.
  From a socioeconomic perspective, our results show that, counterintuitively, diversity
  in the individual sensitivity to social norms may result in a society that better
  follows such norms as a whole, even if part of the population is less prone to follow
  them.
