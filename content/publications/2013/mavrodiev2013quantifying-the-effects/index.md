abstract: How do humans respond to indirect social influence when making decisions?
  We analysed an experiment where subjects had to repeatedly guess the correct answer
  to factual questions, while having only aggregated information about the answers
  of others. While the response of humans to aggregated information is a widely observed
  phenomenon, it has not been investigated quantitatively, in a controlled setting.
  We found that the adjustment of individual guesses depends linearly on the distance
  to the mean of all guesses. This is a remarkable, and yet surprisingly simple, statistical
  regularity. It holds across all questions analysed, even though the correct answers
  differ in several orders of magnitude. Our finding supports the assumption that
  individual diversity does not affect the response to indirect social influence.
  It also complements previous results on the nonlinear response in information-rich
  scenarios. We argue that the nature of the response to social influence crucially
  changes with the level of information aggregation. This insight contributes to the
  empirical foundation of models for collective decisions under social influence.
