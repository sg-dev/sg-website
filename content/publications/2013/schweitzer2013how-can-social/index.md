abstract: "We study a system in which N agents have to decide between two strategies\
  \ θ_((i)) (i ∈ 1... N), for defection or cooperation, when interacting with other\
  \ n agents (either spatial neighbors or randomly chosen ones). After each round,\
  \ they update their strategy responding nonlinearly to two different information\
  \ sources: (i) the payoff a_((i))(θ_((i)), f_((i))) received from the strategic\
  \ interaction with their n counterparts, (ii) the fraction f_((i)) of cooperators\
  \ in this interaction. For the latter response, we assume social herding, i.e. agents\
  \ adopt their strategy based on the frequencies of the different strategies in their\
  \ neighborhood, without taking into account the consequences of this decision. We\
  \ note that f_((i)) already determines the payoff, so there is no additional information\
  \ assumed. A parameter ζ defines to what level agents take the two different information\
  \ sources into account. For the strategic interaction, we assume a Prisoner's Dilemma\
  \ game, i.e. one in which defection is the evolutionary stable strategy. However,\
  \ if the additional dimension of social herding is taken into account, we find instead\
  \ a stable outcome where cooperators are the majority. By means of agent - based\
  \ computer simulations and analytical investigations, we evaluate the critical conditions\
  \ for this transition towards cooperation. We find that, in addition to a high degree\
  \ of social herding, there has to be a nonlinear response to the fraction of cooperators.\
  \ We argue that the transition to cooperation in our model is based on less information,\
  \ i.e. on agents which are not informed about the payoff matrix, and therefore rely\
  \ on just observing the strategy of others, to adopt it. By designing the right\
  \ mechanisms to respond to this information, the transition to cooperation can be\
  \ remarkably enhanced."
