abstract: Time - evolving interaction patterns studied in diﬀerent contexts can be
  well represented bytemporal networks in which nodes are intermittently connected.
  In this Letter we introducethe notion of betweenness preference in the study of
  temporal networks. It captures how likelya certain node is to mediate interactions
  between particular pairs of its neighboring nodes.We argue that betweenness preference
  is an important correlation to consider in the analysisof temporal network data.
  In particular, it allows to assess to which extent paths existing intime - aggregated,
  static representations of temporal networks are actually feasible based onthe underlying
  sequence of interactions. We argue that betweenness preference correlationsare present
  in empirical data sets. We further show that neglecting betweenness preferencewill
  lead to signiﬁcantly wrong statements about spreading dynamics in temporal networks.
