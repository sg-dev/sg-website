abstract: Efﬁcient bug triaging procedures are an important precondition for successful
  collaborative software engineering projects. Triaging bugs can become a laborious
  task particularly in open source software (OSS) projects with a large base of comparably
  inexperienced part - time contributors. In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient and
  practical method to identify valid bug reports which a) refer to an actual software
  bug, b) are not duplicates and c) contain enough information to be processed right
  away. Our classiﬁcation is based on nine measures to quantify the social embeddedness
  of bug reporters in the collaboration network. We demonstrate its applicability
  in a case study, using a comprehensive data set of more than 700, 000 bug reports
  obtained from the BUGZILLA installation of four major OSS communities, for a period
  of more than ten years. For those projects that exhibit the lowest fraction of valid
  bug reports, we ﬁnd that the bug reporters’ position in the collaboration network
  is a strong indicator for the quality of bug reports. Based on this ﬁnding, we develop
  an automated classiﬁcation scheme that can easily be integrated into bug tracking
  platforms and analyze its performance in the considered OSS communities. A support
  vector machine (SVM) to identify valid bug reports based on the nine measures yields
  a precision of up to 90.3% with an associated recall of 38.9%. With this, we signiﬁcantly
  improve the results obtained in previous case studies for an automated early identiﬁcation
  of bugs that are eventually ﬁxed. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential
  of using quantitative measures of social organization in collaborative software
  engineering. It also opens a broad perspective for the integration of social network
  analysis in the design of support infrastructures.
