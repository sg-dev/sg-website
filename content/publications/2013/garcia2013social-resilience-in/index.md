abstract: 'We empirically analyze five online communities: Friendster, Livejournal,
  Facebook, Orkut, Myspace, to identify causes for the decline of social networks.
  We define social resilience as the ability of a community to withstand changes.
  We do not argue about the cause of such changes, but concentrate on their impact.
  Changes may cause users to leave, which may trigger further leaves of others who
  lost connection to their friends. This may lead to cascades of users leaving. A
  social network is said to be resilient if the size of such cascades can be limited.
  To quantify resilience, we use the k-core analysis, to identify subsets of the network
  in which all users have at least k friends. These connections generate benefits
  (b) for each user, which have to outweigh the costs (c) of being a member of the
  network. If this difference is not positive, users leave. After all cascades, the
  remaining network is the k-core of the original network determined by the cost-to-benefit
  c/b ratio. By analysing the cumulative distribution of k-cores we are able to calculate
  the number of users remaining in each community. This allows us to infer the impact
  of the c/b ratio on the resilience of these online communities. We find that the
  different online communities have different k-core distributions. Consequently,
  similar changes in the c/b ratio have a different impact on the amount of active
  users. As a case study, we focus on the evolution of Friendster. We identify time
  periods when new users entering the network observed an insufficient c/b ratio.
  This measure can be seen as a precursor of the later collapse of the community.
  Our analysis can be applied to estimate the impact of changes in the user interface,
  which may temporarily increase the c/b ratio, thus posing a threat for the community
  to shrink, or even to collapse.'
