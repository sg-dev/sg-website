abstract: The structure of a society depends, to some extent, on the incentives of
  the individuals they are composed of. We study a stylized model of this interplay,
  that suggests that the more individuals aim at climbing the social hierarchy, the
  more society's hierarchy gets strong. Such a dependence is sharp, in the sense that
  a persistent hierarchical order emerges abruptly when the preference for social
  status gets larger than a threshold. This phase transition has its origin in the
  fact that the presence of a well defined hierarchy allows agents to climb it, thus
  reinforcing it, whereas in a \"disordered\" society it is harder for agents to find
  out whom they should connect to in order to become more central. Interestingly,
  a social order emerges when agents strive harder to climb society and it results
  in a state of reduced social mobility, as a consequence of ergodicity breaking,
  where climbing is more difficult.
