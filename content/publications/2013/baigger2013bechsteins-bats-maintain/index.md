abstract: Several social mammals, including elephants and some primates, whales and
  bats, live in multi-level societies that form temporary subgroups. Despite these
  fission-fusion dynamics, group members often maintain long-term bonds. However,
  it is unclear whether such individual links and the resulting stable social subunits
  continue to exist after a complete reorganisation of a society, e.g. following a
  population crash. Here we employed a weighted network analysis on 7109 individual
  roosting records collected over four years in a wild Bechstein's bat colony. We
  show that, in response to a strong population decline, the colony's two stable social
  subunits fused into a non-modular social network. Nevertheless, in the first year
  after the crash, long-term bonds were still detectable, suggesting that the bats
  remembered previous individual relationships. Our findings are important for understanding
  the flexibility of animal societies in the face of dramatic changes, and for the
  conservation of social mammals with declining populations.
