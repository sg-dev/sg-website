abstract: Measuring culture and its dynamics through surveys has important limitations,
  but the emerging eld of computational social science allows us to overcome them
  by analyzing large-scale datasets. In this article, we study cultural dynamics through
  the votes in the Eurovision song contest, which are decided by a crowd-based scheme
  in which viewers vote through mobile phone messages. Taking into account asymmetries
  and imperfect perception of culture, we measure cultural relations among European
  countries in terms of cultural anity. We propose the Friend-or-Foe coecient, a metric
  to measure voting biases among participants of a Eurovision contest. To validate
  how this metric represent cultural anity, we designed a model of a random, biased
  Eurovision contest. Simulations of this model show how our metrics can detect negative
  anities and serve as an estimator for positive anities. We apply this estimator
  to the historical set of Eurovision contests from 1975 to 2012, nding patterns of
  asymmetry and clustering in the resulting networks. Furthermore, we dene a measure
  of vote polarization that, when applied to empirical data, shows a sharp increase
  within countries of the EU during 2010 and 2011. As a result, we measure how the
  recent political decisions of EU states inuence the way their citizens relate to
  the culture of other EU members, leading to stronger cultural biases in the way
  they vote in the Eurovision song contest.
