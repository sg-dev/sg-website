abstract: 'We demonstrate by mathematical analysis and systematic computer simulations
  that redistribution can lead to sustainable growth in a society. In accordance with
  economic models of risky human capital, we assume that dynamics of human capital
  is modeled as a multiplicative stochastic process which, in the long run, leads
  to the destruction of individual human capital. When agents are linked by fully
  redistributive taxation the situation might turn to individual growth in the long
  run. We consider that a government collects a proportion of income and reduces it
  by a fraction as costs for administration (efficiency losses). The remaining public
  good is equally redistributed to all agents. Sustainable growth is induced by redistribution
  despite the losses from the random growth process and despite administrative costs.
  Growth results from a portfolio effect. The findings are verified for three different
  tax schemes: proportional tax, taking proportionally more from the rich, and proportionally
  more from the poor. We discuss which of these tax schemes performs better with respect
  to maximize growth under a fixed rate of administrative costs, and the governmental
  income. This leads us to general conclusions about governmental decisions, the relation
  to public good games with free riding, and the function of taxation in a risk-taking
  society.'
