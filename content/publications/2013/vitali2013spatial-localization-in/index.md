abstract: This paper employs a homogeneous - firm database to investigate industry
  localization in European countries. More specifically, it compares, across industries
  and countries, the predictions of two of the most popular localization indexes,
  that is, the Ellison and Glaeser index of 1997 and the Duranton and Overman index
  of 2005. Independently from the index used, it is found that localization is a pervasive
  phenomenon in all countries studied; and the degree of localization is very unevenly
  distributed across industries in each country. Furthermore, it is shown that in
  all countries localized sectors are mainly ‘traditional’ sectors or, if one controls
  for country industrial structures, science - based sectors. Moreover, it is found
  that the two indexes significantly diverge in predicting the intensity of localization
  of the same industry both across and within countries. In turn, these differences
  point to the different role played by pecuniary versus non - pecuniary externalities
  in driving firms' location decisions.
