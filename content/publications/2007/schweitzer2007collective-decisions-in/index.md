abstract: 'Decision making, in a simple sense, means a selection among alternatives.
  It is one of the fundamental processes in economics but also in social systems.
  If these systems consist of many interacting elements — which we call agents here
  — the system dynamics may be described on two different levels: the microscopic
  level, where the decisions of the individual agents occur and the macroscopic level
  where a certain collective behavior can be observed.'
