abstract: We present a simple model of a production network in which firms are linked
  by supplier–customer relationships involving extension of trade–credit. Our aim
  is to identify the minimal set of mechanisms which reproduce qualitatively the main
  stylized facts of industrial demography, such as firms’ size distribution, and,
  at the same time, the correlation, over time and across firms, of output, growth
  and bankruptcies. The behavior of aggregate variables can be traced back to the
  direct firm–firm interdependence. In this paper, we assume that the number of firms
  is constant and the network has a periodic static structure. But the framework allows
  further extensions to investigate which network structures are more robust against
  domino effects and, if the network is let to evolve in time, which structures emerge
  spontaneously, depending on the individual strategies for orders and delivery.
