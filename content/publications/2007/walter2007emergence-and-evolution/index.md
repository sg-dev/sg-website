abstract: 'We investigate the dynamics of the creation, development, and breakup of
  social networks formed by coalitions of agents. As an application, we consider coalition
  formation in a consumer electronic market. In our model, agents have benefits and
  costs from establishing a social network by participating in a coalition. Buyers
  benefit in terms of volume discount and better match of their preferences. Sellers
  benefit in terms of better predictability of sales volumes. The model allows us
  to investigate the stability and size of the coalitions as well as the performance
  of the market in terms of utility of the agents. We find that the system exhibits
  three different dominating regimes: individual purchasing behaviour, i.e., no social
  network exists among the agents, formation of several heterogenous coalitions, i.e.,
  a number of social networks which are not connected, as well as condensation to
  a giant coalition, i.e., a social network involving all agents.'
