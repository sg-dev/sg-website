abstract: We analyze a model of interacting agents (e.g. prebiotic chemical species)
  which are represented by nodes of a network, whereas their interactions are mapped
  onto directed links between these nodes. On a fast time scale, each agent follows
  an eigendynamics based on catalytic support from other nodes, whereas on a much
  slower time scale the network evolves through selection and mutation of its nodes
  - agent. In the first part of the paper, we explain the dynamics of the model by
  means of characteristic snapshots of the network evolution and confirm earlier findings
  on crashes and recoveries in the network structure. In the second part, we focus
  on the aggregate behavior of the network dynamics. We show that the disruptions
  in the network structure are smoothed out, so that the average evolution can be
  described by a growth regime followed by a satura - tion regime, without an initial
  random regime. For the saturation regime, we obtain a logarithmic scaling between
  the average connectivity per node ls and a parameter m, describing the average
  incoming connectivity, which is independent of the system size N.
