abstract: 'We propose a methodological framework to study the dynamics of inter-regional
  investment flow in Europe from a Complex Networks perspective, an approach with
  recent proven success in many fields including economics. In this work we study
  the network of investment stocks in Europe at two different levels: first, we compute
  the inward-outward investment stocks at the level of firms, based on ownership shares
  and number of employees; then we estimate the inward-outward investment stock at
  the level of regions in Europe, by aggregating the ownership network of firms, based
  on their headquarter location. Despite the intuitive value of this approach for
  EU policy making in economic development, to our knowledge there are no similar
  works in the literature yet. In this paper we focus on statistical distributions
  and scaling laws of activity, investment stock and connectivity degree both at the
  level of firms and at the level of regions. In particular we find that investment
  stock of firms is power law distributed with an exponent very close to the one found
  for firm activity. On the other hand investment stock and activity of regions turn
  out to be log-normal distributed. At both levels we find scaling laws relating investment
  to activity and connectivity. In particular, we find that investment stock scales
  with connectivity in a similar way as has been previously found for stock market
  data, calling for further investigations on a possible general scaling law holding
  true in economical networks.'
