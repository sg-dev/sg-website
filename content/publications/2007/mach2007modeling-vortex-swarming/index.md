abstract: Based on experimental observations in Daphnia, we introduce an agent-based
  model for the motion of single and swarms of animals. Each agent is described by
  a stochastic equation that also considers the conditions for active biological motion.
  An environmental potential further reflects local conditions for Daphnia, such as
  attraction to light sources. This model is sufficient to describe the observed cycling
  behavior of single Daphnia. To simulate vortex swarming of many Daphnia, i.e. the
  collective rotation of the swarm in one direction, we extend the model by considering
  avoidance of collisions. Two different ansatzes to model such a behavior are developed
  and compared. By means of computer simulations of a multi-agent system we show that
  local avoidance-as a special form of asymmetric repulsion between animals-leads
  to the emergence of a vortex swarm. The transition from uncorrelated rotation of
  single agents to the vortex swarming as a function of the swarm size is investigated.
  Eventually, some evidence of avoidance behavior in Daphnia is provided by comparing
  experimental and simulation results for two animals.
