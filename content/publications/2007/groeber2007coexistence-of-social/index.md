abstract: The question how social norms can emerge from microscopic interactions between
  individuals is a key problem in social sciences to explain collective behavior.
  In this paper we propose an agent-based model to show that randomly distributed
  social behavior by way of local interaction converges to a state with a multimodal
  distribution of behavior. This can be interpreted as a coexistence of different
  social norms, a result that goes beyond previous investigations. The model is discrete
  in time and space, behavior is characterized in a continuous state space. The adaptation
  of social behavior by each agent is based on attractive and repulsive forces caused
  by friendly and adversary relations among agents. The model is analyzed both analytically
  and by means of spatio-temporal computer simulations. It provides conditions under
  which we find convergence towards a single norm, coexistence of two opposing norms,
  and coexistence of a multitude of norms. For the latter case, we also show the evolution
  of the spatio-temporal distribution of behavior.
