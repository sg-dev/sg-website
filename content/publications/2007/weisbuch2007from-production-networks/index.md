abstract: Although standard economics textbooks are seldom interested in production
  networks, modern economies are more and more based upon supplier/customer interactions.Onecan
  consider entire sectors of theeconomy as generalised supply chains.We will take
  this view in the present paper and study under which conditions local failures to
  produce or simply to deliver can result in avalanches of shortage and bankruptcies
  and in localisation of the economic activity.We will showthat a large class of models
  exhibit scale free distributions of production and wealth among firms and that regions
  of high production are localised.
