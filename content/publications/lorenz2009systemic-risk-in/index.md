abstract: We introduce a general framework for models of cascade and contagion processes
  on networks, to identify their commonalities and differences. In particular, models
  of social and financial cascades, as well as the fiber bundle model, the voter model,
  and models of epidemic spreading are recovered as special cases. To unify their
  description, we define the net fragility of a node, which is the difference between
  its fragility and the threshold that determines its failure. Nodes fail if their
  net fragility grows above zero and their failure increases the fragility of neighbouring
  nodes, thus possibly triggering a cascade. In this framework, we identify three
  classes depending on the way the fragility of a node is increased by the failure
  of a neighbour. At the microscopic level, we illustrate with specific examples how
  the failure spreading pattern varies with the node triggering the cascade, depending
  on its position in the network and its degree. At the macroscopic level, systemic
  risk is measured as the final fraction of failed nodes, X∗,and for each of the three
  classes we derive a recursive equation to compute its value. The phase diagram of
  X∗ as a function of the initial conditions, thus allows for a prediction of the
  systemic risk as well as a comparison of the three different model classes. We could
  identify which model class leads to a first - order phase transition in systemic
  risk, i.e. situations where small changes in the initial conditions determine a
  global failure. Eventually, we generalize our framework to encompass stochastic
  contagion models. This indicates the potential for further generalizations.
