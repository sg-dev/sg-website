abstract: "We investigate an extension of the voter model in which voters are equipped\
  \ with an individual inertia to change their opinion. This inertia depends on the\
  \ persistence time of a voter's current opinion (ageing). We focus on the case of\
  \ only two different inertia values: zero if a voter just changed towards a new\
  \ opinion and nu otherwise. We are interested in the average time to reach consensus,\
  \ i.e. the state in which all voters have adopted the same opinion. Adding inertia\
  \ to the system means to slow down the dynamics at the voter's level, which should\
  \ presumably lead to a slower consensus formation. As an unexpected outcome of our\
  \ inertial voter dynamics, there is a parameter region of nu where an increasing\
  \ inertia leads to a faster consensus formation. These results rest on the heterogeneity\
  \ of voters which evolves through the described ageing. In a control setting of\
  \ homogeneous inertia values, we only find monotonously increasing consensus times.\
  \ In the paper, we present dynamical equations for the mean-field case which allow\
  \ for analytical insight into the observed slower-is-faster effect."
