abstract: We present analytical investigations of a multiplicative stochastic process
  that models a simple investor dynamics in a random environment. The dynamics of
  the investor's budget, $x(t)$, depends on the stochasticity of the return on investment,
  $r(t)$, for which different model assumptions are discussed. The fat-tail distribution
  of the budget is investigated and compared with theoretical predictions. Weare mainly
  interested in the most probable value $x_mp$ of the budget that reaches a constant
  value over time. Based on an analytical investigation of the dynamics, we are able
  to predict $x_mp^stat$. We find a scaling law that relates the most probable value
  to the characteristic parameters describing the stochastic process. Our analytical
  results are confirmed by stochastic computer simulations that show a very good agreement
  with the predictions.
