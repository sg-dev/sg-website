abstract: The reputation of firms is largely channeled through their ownership structure.
  We use this relation to determine reputation spillovers between transnational companies
  and their participated companies in an ownership network core of 1318 firms. We
  then apply concepts of network controllability to identify minimum sets of driver
  nodes (MDS) of 314 firms in this network. The importance of these driver nodes is
  classified regarding their control contribution, their operating revenue, and their
  reputation. The latter two are also taken as proxies for the access costs when utilizing
  firms as driver nodes. Using an enrichment analysis, we find that firms with high
  reputation maintain the controllability of the network, but rarely become top drivers,
  whereas firms with medium reputation most likely become top driver nodes. We further
  show that MDSs with lower access costs can be used to control the reputation dynamics
  in the whole network.
