abstract: Name disambiguation is a complex but highly relevant challenge whenever
  analysing real-world user data, such as data from version control systems. We propose
  gambit, a rule-based disambiguation tool that only relies on name and email information.
  We evaluate its performance against two commonly used algorithms with similar characteristics
  on manually disambiguated ground-truth data from the Gnome GTK project. Our results
  show that gambit significantly outperforms both algorithms, achieving an F1 score
  of 0.985.
