abstract: High skill labour is an important factor underpinning the competitive advantage
  of modern economies. Therefore, attracting and retaining scientists has become a
  major concern for migration policy. In this work, we study the migration of scientists
  on a global scale, by combining two large data sets covering the publications of
  3.5 million scientists over 60 years. We analyse their geographical distances moved
  for a new affiliation and their age when moving, this way reconstructing their geographical
  ``career paths''. These paths are used to derive the world network of scientists'
  mobility between cities and to analyse its topological properties. We further develop
  and calibrate an agent-based model, such that it reproduces the empirical findings
  both at the level of scientists and of the global network. Our model takes into
  account that the academic hiring process is largely demand-driven and demonstrates
  that the probability of scientists to relocate decreases both with age and with
  distance. Our results allow interpreting the model assumptions as micro-based decision
  rules that can explain the observed mobility patterns of scientists.
