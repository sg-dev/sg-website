abstract: 'We propose an agent - based model of collective opinion formation to study
  the wisdom of crowds under social influence. The opinion of an agent is a continuous
  positive value, denoting its subjective answer to a factual question. The wisdom
  of crowds states that the average of all opinions is close to the truth, i.e. the
  correct answer. But if agents have the chance to adjust their opinion in response
  to the opinions of others, this effect can be destroyed. Our model investigates
  this scenario by evaluating two competing effects: (i) agents tend to keep their
  own opinion (individual conviction β), (ii) they tend to adjust their opinion if
  they have information about the opinions of others (social influence α). For the
  latter, two different regimes (full information vs. aggregated information) are
  compared. Our simulations show that social influence only in rare cases enhances
  the wisdom of crowds. Most often, we find that agents converge to a collective opinion
  that is even farther away from the true answer. So, under social influence the wisdom
  of crowds can be systematically wrong.'
