abstract: Geo-spatial factors were a major driving force for the European  Reformation.
  Power relations between neighboring territorial states, travel routes of  scholars,
  and locations of cultural exchange contributed to the spread of  Protestantism.
  However, researchers cannot study these factors quantitatively because  spatial
  data on territories in the 16th century does not exist. I develop a manual  and
  an automatic method to extract the geo-coordinates of territories from  political
  maps and enrich them with non-spatial attributes gathered from Wikipedia.  The manual
  method extracts unambiguous territories and the automatic method is  re- producible
  and time saving. The generated data can be used to study  confessional- ization
  and other aspects of the Reformation. The methodology can be  generalized to other
  geographic areas and historical periods.
