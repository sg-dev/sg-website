	abstract={Geo-spatial factors were a major driving force for the European 
	Reformation.
	Power relations between neighboring territorial states, travel routes of 
	scholars,
	and locations of cultural exchange contributed to the spread of 
	Protestantism.
	However, researchers cannot study these factors quantitatively because 
	spatial
	data on territories in the 16th century does not exist. I develop a manual 
	and
	an automatic method to extract the geo-coordinates of territories from 
	political
	maps and enrich them with non-spatial attributes gathered from Wikipedia. 
	The
	manual method extracts unambiguous territories and the automatic method is 
	re-
	producible and time saving. The generated data can be used to study 
	confessional-
	ization and other aspects of the Reformation. The methodology can be 
	generalized
	to other geographic areas and historical periods.},
