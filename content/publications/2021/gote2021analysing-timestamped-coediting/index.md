abstract: Data from software repositories have become an important foundation for
  the empirical study of software engineering processes. A recurring theme in the
  repository mining literature is the inference of developer networks capturing e.g.
  collaboration, coordination, or communication from the commit history of projects.
  Many works in this area studied networks of co-authorship of software artefacts,
  neglecting detailed information on code changes and code ownership available in
  software repositories. To address this issue, we introduce git2net, a scalable python
  software that facilitates the extraction of fine-grained co-editing networks in
  large git repositories. It uses text mining techniques to analyse the detailed history
  of textual modifications within files. We apply our tool in two case studies using
  GitHub repositories of multiple Open Source as well as a proprietary software project.
  Specifically, we use data on more than 1.2 million commits and more than 25,000
  developers to test a hypothesis on the relation between developer productivity and
  co-editing patterns in software teams. We argue that git2net opens up an important
  new source of high-resolution data on human collaboration patterns that can be used
  to advance theory in empirical software engineering, computational social science,
  and organisational studies.
