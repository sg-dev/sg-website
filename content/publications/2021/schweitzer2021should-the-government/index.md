abstract: In our multi - agent model agents generate wealth from repeated interactions
  for which a prisoner's dilemma payoff matrix is assumed. Their gains are taxed by
  a government at a rate Î±. The resulting budget is spent to cover administrative
  costs and to pay a bonus to cooperative agents, which can be identified correctly
  only with a probability p. Agents decide at each time step to choose either cooperation
  or defection based on different information. In the local scenario, they compare
  their potential gains from both strategies. In the global scenario, they compare
  the gains of the cooperative and defective subpopulations. We derive analytical
  expressions for the critical bonus needed to make cooperation as attractive as defection.
  We show that for the local scenario the government can establish only a medium level
  of cooperation, because the critical bonus increases with the level of cooperation.
  In the global scenario instead full cooperation can be achieved once the cold -
  start problem is solved, because the critical bonus decreases with the level of
  cooperation. This allows to lower the tax rate, while maintaining high cooperation.
