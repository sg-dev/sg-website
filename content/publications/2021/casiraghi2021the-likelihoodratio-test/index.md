abstract: The complexity underlying real-world systems implies that standard statistical
  hypothesis testing methods may not be adequate for these peculiar applications.
  Specifically, we show that the likelihood-ratio test's null-distribution needs to
  be modified to accommodate the complexity found in multi-edge network data. When
  working with independent observations, the p-values of likelihood-ratio tests are
  approximated using a $χ^2$ distribution. However, such an approximation should not
  be used when dealing with multi-edge network data. This type of data is characterized
  by multiple correlations and competitions that make the standard approximation unsuitable.
  We provide a solution to the problem by providing a better approximation of the
  likelihood-ratio test null-distribution through a Beta distribution. Finally, we
  empirically show that even for a small multi-edge network, the standard $χ^2$ approximation
  provides erroneous results, while the proposed Beta approximation yields the correct
  p-value estimation.
