abstract: With the increasing availability of online scholarly databases, publication
  records can be easily extracted and analysed. Researchers can promptly keep abreast
  of others' scientific production and, in principle, can select new collaborators
  and build new research teams. A critical factor one should consider when contemplating
  new potential collaborations is the possibility of unambiguously defining the expertise
  of other researchers. While some organisations have established database systems
  to enable their members to manually produce a profile, maintaining such systems
  is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in retrieving
  expertise through automated approaches. Indeed, the identification of researchers'
  expertise is of great value in many applications, such as identifying qualified
  experts to supervise new researchers, assigning manuscripts to reviewers, and forming
  a qualified team. Here, we propose a network-based approach to the construction
  of authors' expertise profiles. Using the MEDLINE corpus as an example, we show
  that our method can be applied to a number of widely used data sets and outperforms
  other methods traditionally used for expertise identification.
