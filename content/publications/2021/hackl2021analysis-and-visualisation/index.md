abstract: The Open Source software package pathpy, available at https://www.pathpy.net,
  implements statistical techniques to learn optimal graphical models for the causal
  topology generated by paths in time-series data. Operationalizing Occam's razor,
  these models balance model complexity with explanatory power for empirically observed
  paths in relational time series. Standard network analysis is justified if the inferred
  optimal model is a first-order network model. Optimal models with orders larger
  than one indicate higher-order dependencies and can be used to improve the analysis
  of dynamical processes, node centralities and clusters.
