abstract: '\"Wisdom of crowds\" refers to the phenomenon that the average opinion
  of a group of individuals on a given question can be very close to the true answer.
  It requires a large group diversity of opinions, but the collective error, the difference
  between the average opinion and the true value, has to be small. We consider a stochastic
  opinion dynamics where individuals can change their opinion based on the opinions
  of others (social influence α), but to some degree also stick to their initial opinion
  (individual conviction β). We then derive analytic expressions for the dynamics
  of the collective error and the group diversity. We analyze their long - term behavior
  to determine the impact of the two parameters (α,β) and the initial opinion distribution
  on the wisdom of crowds. This allows us to quantify the ambiguous role of social
  influence: only if the initial collective error is large, it helps to improve the
  wisdom of crowds, but in most cases it deteriorates the outcome. In these cases,
  individual conviction still improves the wisdom of crowds because it mitigates the
  impact of social influence.'
