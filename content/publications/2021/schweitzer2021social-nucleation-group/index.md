abstract: ' The spontaneous formation and subsequent growth, dissolution, merger and
  competition of social groups bears similarities to physical phase transitions in
  metastable finite systems.  We examine three different scenarios, percolation, spinodal
  decomposition and nucleation, to describe the formation of social groups of varying
  size and density.  In our agent-based model, we use a feedback between the opinions
  of agents and their ability to establish links.  Groups can restrict further link
  formation, but agents can also leave if costs exceed the group benefits.  We identify
  the critical parameters for costs/benefits and social influence to obtain either
  one large group or the stable coexistence of several groups with different opinions.  Analytic
  investigations allow to derive different critical densities that control the formation
  and coexistence of groups. Our novel approach sheds new light on the early stage
  of network growth and the emergence of large connected components.  '
