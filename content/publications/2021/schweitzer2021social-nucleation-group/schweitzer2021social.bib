  abstract =	 { The spontaneous formation and subsequent growth, dissolution, merger and
                  competition of social groups bears similarities to physical phase transitions in
                  metastable finite systems.  We examine three different scenarios, percolation,
                  spinodal decomposition and nucleation, to describe the formation of social groups
                  of varying size and density.  In our agent-based model, we use a feedback between
                  the opinions of agents and their ability to establish links.  Groups can restrict
                  further link formation, but agents can also leave if costs exceed the group
                  benefits.  We identify the critical parameters for costs/benefits and social
                  influence to obtain either one large group or the stable coexistence of several
                  groups with different opinions.  Analytic investigations allow to derive different
                  critical densities that control the formation and coexistence of groups.Our novel
                  approach sheds new light on the early stage of network growth and the emergence of
                  large connected components.  }
