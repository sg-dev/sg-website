abstract: The dynamics of collaboration networks of firms follow a life cycle of growth
  and decline. That does not imply they also become less resilient. Instead, declining
  collaboration networks may still have the ability to mitigate shocks from firms
  leaving and to recover from these losses by adapting to new partners. To demonstrate
  this, we analyze 21.500 R&D collaborations of 14.500 firms in six different industrial
  sectors over 25Â years. We calculate time-dependent probabilities of firms leaving
  the network and simulate drop-out cascades to determine the expected dynamics of
  decline. We then show that deviations from these expectations result from the adaptivity
  of the network, which mitigates the decline. These deviations can be used as a measure
  of network resilience.
