abstract: ' Proponents describe stem Cell Replacement Therapy and related technologies
  to be a significant step forward for medicine. However, due to the inherent ethical
  problems in human Embryonic Stem Cell Research (hESC), it is strictly regulated
  around the world. The US has passed at the federal and state level, both supportive
  and restrictive laws over the years. The changing legislative environment at the
  state and federal levels has created a situation whereby researchers have to choose
  whether and where to carry out this research. By exploiting the temporal and spatial
  heterogeneity and legislative shocks, we assess if the affected scientists have
  voted with their feet, leaving the state or country imposing restrictive rules and
  whether hESC research has clustered geographically. We find that most of the hESC
  research is carried out in supportive states, and significant legislative changes
  have had a minor but noticeable effect on relocation choices. Most importantly,
  the research has moved to supportive states. This result suggests that several state-level
  interventions (supportive), which were opposed to federal laws (restrictive), have
  counteracted each other. '
