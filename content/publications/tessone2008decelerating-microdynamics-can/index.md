abstract: For the voter model, we study the effect of a memory-dependent transition
  rate. We assume that the transition of a spin into the opposite state decreases
  with the time it has been in its current state. Counterintuitively, we find that
  the time to reach a macroscopically ordered state can be accelerated by slowing
  down the microscopic dynamics in this way. This holds for different network topologies,
  including fully connected ones. We find that the ordering dynamics is governed by
  two competing processes which either stabilize the majority or the minority state.
  If the first one dominates, it accelerates the ordering of the system. The conclusions
  of this Letter are not restricted to the voter model, but remain valid to many other
  spin systems as well.
