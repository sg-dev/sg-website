abstract: The extraction of relevant knowledge from the increasingly large amountof
  information available in information repositories is one of the big challenges of
  ourtime. Although it is clear that the social and the information layer of collaborativeknowledge
  spaces like the World Wide Web (WWW), scholarly publication databasesor Online Social
  Networks (OSNs) are inherently coupled and thus inseparable, thequestion how the
  ranking and retrieval of information is inï¬‚uenced by the structureand dynamics of
  the social systems that create it has been addressed at most partially.In this talk,
  we will highlight associated research questions and challenges from anethical, social
  and computer science perspective and introduce a multiplex networkperspective that
  integrates both the social and the semantic layer of social informationsystems.
