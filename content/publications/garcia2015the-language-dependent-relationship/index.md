abstract: Dodds et al. (1) present a universal positivity bias—in 10 human languages—that
  they claim is independent of word frequency. This result contradicts previous findings
  (2, 3) in which a relationship between word happiness and frequency is reported
  for a variety of languages and large - scale datasets. To better understand this
  contradiction, we reanalyze the labMT (language assessment by Mechanical Turk) data
  produced in Dodds et al. (1) against a larger reference lexicon (3). Our reanalysis
  shows that the data used in Dodds et al. (1) does not support their claims.
