abstract: "We study the changes in emotional states induced by reading and participating\
  \ in online discussions, empirically testing a computational model of online emotional\
  \ interaction. Using principles of dynamical systems, we quantify changes in valence\
  \ and arousal through subjective reports, as recorded in three independent studies\
  \ including 207 participants (110 female). In the context of online discussions,\
  \ the dynamics of valence and arousal are composed of two forces: an internal relaxation\
  \ towards baseline values independent of the emotional charge of the discussion,\
  \ and a driving force of emotional states that depends on the content of the discussion.\
  \ The dynamics of valence show the existence of positive and negative tendencies,\
  \ while arousal increases when reading emotional content regardless of its polarity.\
  \ The tendency of participants to take part in the discussion increases with positive\
  \ arousal. When participating in an online discussion, the content of participants'\
  \ expression depends on their valence, and their arousal significantly decreases\
  \ afterwards as a regulation mechanism. We illustrate how these results allow the\
  \ design of agent-based models to reproduce and analyze emotions in online communities.\
  \ Our work empirically validates the microdynamics of a model of online collective\
  \ emotions, bridging online data analysis with research in the laboratory. "
