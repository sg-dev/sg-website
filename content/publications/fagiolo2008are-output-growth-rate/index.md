abstract: 'This work explores some distributional properties of aggregate output growth-rate
  time series. We show that, in the majority of OECD countries, output growth-rate
  distributions are well-approximated by symmetric exponential-power densities with
  tails much fatter than those of a Gaussian. Fat tails robustly emerge in output
  growth rates independently of: (i) the way we measure aggregate output; (ii) the
  family of densities employed in the estimation; (iii) the length of time lags used
  to compute growth rates. We also show that fat tails still characterize output growth-rate
  distributions even after one washes away outliers, autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity.'
