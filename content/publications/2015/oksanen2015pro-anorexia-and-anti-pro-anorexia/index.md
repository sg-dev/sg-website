abstract: 'Background: Pro - anorexia communities exist online and encourage harmful
  weight loss and weight control practices, often through emotional content that enforces
  social ties within these communities. User - generated responses to videos that
  directly oppose pro - anorexia communities have not yet been researched in depth.Objective:
  The aim was to study emotional reactions to pro - anorexia and anti - pro - anorexia
  online content on YouTube using sentiment analysis.Methods: Using the 50 most popular
  YouTube pro - anorexia and anti - pro - anorexia user channels as a starting point,
  we gathered data on users, their videos, and their commentators. A total of 395
  anorexia videos and 12,161 comments were analyzed using positive and negative sentiments
  and ratings submitted by the viewers of the videos. The emotional information was
  automatically extracted with an automatic sentiment detection tool whose reliability
  was tested with human coders. Ordinary least squares regression models were used
  to estimate the strength of sentiments. The models controlled for the number of
  video views and comments, number of months the video had been on YouTube, duration
  of the video, uploader’s activity as a video commentator, and uploader’s physical
  location by country.Results: The 395 videos had more than 6 million views and comments
  by almost 8000 users. Anti - pro - anorexia video comments expressed more positive
  sentiments on a scale of 1 to 5 (adjusted prediction [AP] 2.15, 95% CI 2.11 - 2.19)
  than did those of pro - anorexia videos (AP 2.02, 95% CI 1.98 - 2.06). Anti - pro
  - anorexia videos also received more likes (AP 181.02, 95% CI 155.19 - 206.85) than
  pro - anorexia videos (AP 31.22, 95% CI 31.22 - 37.81). Negative sentiments and
  video dislikes were equally distributed in responses to both pro - anorexia and
  anti - pro - anorexia videos.Conclusions: Despite pro - anorexia content being widespread
  on YouTube, videos promoting help for anorexia and opposing the pro - anorexia community
  were more popular, gaining more positive feedback and comments than pro - anorexia
  videos. Thus, the anti - pro - anorexia content provided a user - generated counterforce
  against pro - anorexia content on YouTube. Professionals working with young people
  should be aware of the social media dynamics and versatility of user - generated
  eating disorder content online.'
