abstract: Large collaborative software engineering projects are interesting examples
  for evolving complex systems. The complexity of these systems unfolds both in evolving
  software structures, as well as in the social dynamics and organization of development
  teams. Due to the adoption of Open Source practices and the increasing use of online
  support infrastructures, large-scale data sets covering both the social and technical
  dimension of collaborative software engineering processes are increasingly becoming
  available. In the analysis of these data, a growing number of studies employ a network
  perspective, using methods and abstractions from network science to generate insights
  about software engineering processes. Featuring a collection of inspiring works
  in this area, with this topical issue, we intend to give an overview of state-of-the-art
  research. We hope that this collection of articles will stimulate downstream applications
  of network-based data mining techniques in empirical software engineering.
