abstract: We study the two - particle annihilation reaction A + B→∅ on interconnected
  scale - free networks, using different interconnecting strategies. We explore how
  the mixing of particles and the process evolution are influenced by the number of
  interconnecting links, by their functional properties, and by the interconnectivity
  strategies in use. We show that the reaction rates on this system are faster than
  what was observed in other topologies, due to the better particle mixing that suppresses
  the segregation effect, in line with previous studies performed on single scale
  - free networks.
