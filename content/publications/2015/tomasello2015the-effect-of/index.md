abstract: "We develop an agent-based model to reproduce the processes of link formation\
  \ and knowledge exchange in a Research and Development (R&D) inter-organizational\
  \ network. In our model, agents form links based on their network features, i.e.\
  \ their belonging to one of the network's circles of influence and their previous\
  \ alliance history, and then exchange knowledge with their partners, thus modifying\
  \ their positions in a metric knowledge space. Furthermore, we validate the model\
  \ against real data using a two-step approach. Through the Thomson Reuters SDC alliance\
  \ dataset, we estimate the model parameters related to the link formation, thus\
  \ reproducing the topology of the resulting R&D network. Subsequently, using the\
  \ NBER data on firm patents, we estimate the parameters related to the knowledge\
  \ exchange process, thus evaluating the rate at which firms exchange knowledge and\
  \ the duration of the R&D alliances themselves. The underlying knowledge space that\
  \ we consider in our real example is defined by IPC patent classes, allowing for\
  \ a precise quantification of every firm's knowledge position. Our novel data-driven\
  \ approach allows us to unveil the complex interdependencies between the firms'\
  \ network embeddedness and their technological positions. Through the validation\
  \ of our model, we find that real R&D alliances have a duration of around two years,\
  \ and that the subsequent knowledge exchange occurs at a very low rate. Most of\
  \ the alliances, indeed, have no consequence on the partners' knowledge positions:\
  \ this suggests that a firm's position - evaluated through its patents - is rather\
  \ a determinant than a consequence of its R&D alliances. Finally, we propose an\
  \ indicator of collaboration performance for the whole network. We find that the\
  \ real R&D network does not maximize such an indicator. Our study shows that there\
  \ exist configurations that can be both realistic and optimized with respect to\
  \ the collaboration performance. Effective policies to obtain an optimized collaboration\
  \ network - as suggested by our model - would incentivize shorter R&D alliances\
  \ and higher knowledge exchange rates, for instance including rewards for quick\
  \ co-patenting by allied firms."
