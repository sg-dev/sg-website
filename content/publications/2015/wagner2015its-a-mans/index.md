abstract: Wikipedia is a community - created encyclopedia that contains information
  about notable people from different countries, epochs and disciplines and aims to
  document the worldâ€™s knowledge from a neutral point of view. However, the narrow
  diversity of the Wikipedia editor community has the potential to introduce systemic
  biases such as gender biases into the content of Wikipedia. In this paper we aim
  to tackle a sub problem of this larger challenge by presenting and applying a computational
  method for assessing gender bias on Wikipedia along multiple dimensions. We find
  that while women on Wikipedia are covered and featured well in many Wikipedia language
  editions, the way women are portrayed starkly differs from the way men are portrayed.
  We hope our work contributes to increasing awareness about gender biases online,
  and in particular to raising attention to the different levels in which gender biases
  can manifest themselves on the web.
