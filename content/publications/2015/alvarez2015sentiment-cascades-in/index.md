abstract: Recent grassroots movements have suggested that online social networks might
  play a key role in their organization, as adherents have a fast, many-to-many, communication
  channel to help coordinate their mobilization. The structure and dynamics of the
  networks constructed from the digital traces of protesters have been analyzed to
  some extent recently. However, less effort has been devoted to the analysis of the
  semantic content of messages exchanged during the protest. Using the data obtained
  from a microblogging service during the brewing and active phases of the 15M movement
  in Spain, we perform the first large scale test of theories on collective emotions
  and social interaction in collective actions. Our findings show that activity and
  information cascades in the movement are larger in the presence of negative collective
  emotions and when users express themselves in terms related to social content. At
  the level of individual participants, our results show that their social integration
  in the movement, as measured through social network metrics, increases with their
  level of engagement and of expression of negativity. Our findings show that non-rational
  factors play a role in the formation and activity of social movements through online
  media, having important consequences for viral spreading.
