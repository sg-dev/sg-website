abstract: Location-sharing services were built upon people's desire to share their
  activities and locations with others. By \"checking-in\" to a place, such as a restaurant,
  a park, gym, or train station, people disclose where they are, thereby providing
  valuable information about land use and utilization of services in urban areas.
  This information may, in turn, be used to design smarter, happier, more equitable
  cities. We use data from Foursquare location-sharing service to identify areas within
  a major US metropolitan area with many check-ins, i.e., areas that people like to
  use. We then use data from the Twitter microblogging platform to analyze the properties
  of these areas. Specifically, we have extracted a large corpus of geo-tagged messages,
  called tweets, from a major metropolitan area and linked them US Census data through
  their locations. This allows us to measure the sentiment expressed in tweets that
  are posted from a specific area, and also use that area's demographic properties
  in analysis. Our results reveal that areas with many check-ins are different from
  other areas within the metropolitan region. In particular, these areas have happier
  tweets, which also encourage people from other areas to commute longer distances
  to these places. These findings shed light on human mobility patterns, as well as
  how physical environment influences human emotions.
