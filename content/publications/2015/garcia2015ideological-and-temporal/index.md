abstract: Political polarization is traditionally analyzed through the ideological
  stances of groups and parties, but it also has a behavioral component that manifests
  in the interactions between individuals. We present an empirical analysis of the
  digital traces of politicians in politnetz.ch, a Swiss online platform focused on
  political activity, in which politicians interact by creating support links, comments,
  and likes. We analyze network polarization as the level of intra-party cohesion
  with respect to inter-party connectivity, finding that supports show a very strongly
  polarized structure with respect to party alignment. The analysis of this multiplex
  network shows that each layer of interaction contains relevant information, where
  comment groups follow topics related to Swiss politics. Our analysis reveals that
  polarization in the layer of likes evolves in time, increasing close to the federal
  elections of 2011. Furthermore, we analyze the internal social network of each party
  through metrics related to hierarchical structures, information efficiency, and
  social resilience. Our results suggest that the online social structure of a party
  is related to its ideology, and reveal that the degree of connectivity across two
  parties increases when they are close in the ideological space of a multi-party
  system.
