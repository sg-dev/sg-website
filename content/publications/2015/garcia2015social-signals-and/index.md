abstract: The availability of data on digital traces is growing to unprecedented sizes,
  but inferring actionable knowledge from large-scale data is far from being trivial.
  This is especially important for computational finance, where digital traces of
  human behaviour offer a great potential to drive trading strategies. We contribute
  to this by providing a consistent approach that integrates various datasources in
  the design of algorithmic traders. This allows us to derive insights into the principles
  behind the profitability of our trading strategies. We illustrate our approach through
  the analysis of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations.
  In our analysis, we include economic signals of volume and price of exchange for
  USD, adoption of the Bitcoin technology and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add
  social signals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence
  and opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more than
  3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and exchange
  volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence precedes opinion
  polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these insights to design algorithmic
  trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very high profits in less than a year.
  We verify this high profitability with robust statistical methods that take into
  account risk and trading costs, confirming the long-standing hypothesis that trading-based
  social media sentiment has the potential to yield positive returns on investment.
