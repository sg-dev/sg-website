abstract: Counterparty risk denotes the risk that a party defaults in a bilateral
  contract. This risk not only depends on the two parties involved, but also on the
  risk from various other contracts each of these parties holds. In rather informal
  markets, such as the OTC (over-the-counter) derivative market, institutions only
  report their aggregated quarterly risk exposure, but no details about their counterparties.
  Hence, little is known about the diversification of counterparty risk. In this paper,
  we reconstruct the weighted and time-dependent network of counterparty risk in the
  OTC derivatives market of the United States between 1998 and 2012. To proxy unknown
  bilateral exposures, we first study the co-occurrence patterns of institutions based
  on their quarterly activity and ranking in the official report. The network obtained
  this way is further analysed by a weighted k-core decomposition, to reveal a core-periphery
  structure. This allows us to compare the activity-based ranking with a topology-based
  ranking, to identify the most important institutions and their mutual dependencies.
  We also analyse correlations in these activities, to show strong similarities in
  the behavior of the core institutions. Our analysis clearly demonstrates the clustering
  of counterparty risk in a small set of about a dozen US banks. This not only increases
  the default risk of the central institutions, but also the default risk of peripheral
  institutions which have contracts with the central ones. Hence, all institutions
  indirectly have to bear (part of) the counterparty risk of all others, which needs
  to be better reflected in the price of OTC derivatives.
