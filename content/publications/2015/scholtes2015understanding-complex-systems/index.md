abstract: Better understanding and controlling complex systems has become a grand
  challenge not only for computer science, but also for the natural and social sciences.
  Many of these systems have in common that they can be studied from a network perspective.
  Consequently methods from network science have proven instrumental in their analysis.
  In this article, I introduce the macroscopic perspective that is at the heart of
  network science. Summarizing my recent research activities, I discuss how a combination
  of this perspective with Big Data methods can improve our understanding of complex
  systems.
