abstract: Metastasizing tumor cells migrate through the surrounding tissue and extracellular
  matrix toward the blood vessels, in order to colonize distant organs. They typically
  move in a dense environment, filled with other cells. In this work we study cooperative
  effects between neighboring cells of different types, migrating in a maze-like environment
  with directional cue. Using a computerized model, we measure the percentage of cells
  that arrive to the defined target, for different mesenchymal/amoeboid ratios. Wall
  degradation of mesenchymal cells, as well as motility of both types of cells, are
  coupled to metabolic energy-like resource level. We find that indirect cooperation
  emerges in mid-level energy, as mesenchymal cells create paths that are used by
  amoeboids. Therefore, we expect to see a small population of mesenchymals kept in
  a mostly-amoeboid population. We also study different forms of direct interaction
  between the cells, and show that energy-dependent interaction strength is optimal
  for the migration of both mesenchymals and amoeboids. The obtained characteristics
  of cellular cluster size are in agreement with experimental results. We therefore
  predict that hybrid states, e.g. epithelial-mesenchymal, should be utilized as a
  stress-response mechanism.
