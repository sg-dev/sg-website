    abstract = "System design â€“ the term immediately evokes associations with the freedoms of a divine creator. However, it is precisely this idea that already describes the problem: like any other design, system design must respect certain boundaries, but the complexity of the design is far greater. Before we can even formulate systems design questions, we must first clarify what we want to mean by a system, which approach we choose to system modelling, and how we validate these models. This addresses the methodological - technical aspects of systems design. The methodological - critical perspective focuses on the limits of systems design. What do we actually want to achieve with systems design? It doesn't take long to draw up a wish list. But how meaningful or feasible are these wishes? Here, we must critically question our expectations.",
