    abstract = " Viral marketing seeks to maximize the spread of a campaign
through an online social network, often targeting influential nodes with high
centrality. In this article, we analyze behavioral aspects of influential
users in trust-based product reviews communities, quantifying emotional
expression, helpfulness, and user activity level. We focus on two independent
product review communities, Dooyoo and Epinions, in which
users can write product reviews and define trust links to filter product
recommendations. Following the patterns of social contagion processes, we
measure user social influence by means of the k-shell decomposition of trust
networks. For each of these users, we apply sentiment analysis to extract
their extent of positive, negative, and neutral emotional expression. In
addition, we quantify the level of feedback they received in their reviews,
the length of their contributions, and their level of activity over their
lifetime in the community. We find that users of both communities exhibit a
large heterogeneity of social influence, and that helpfulness votes and age
are significantly better predictors of the influence of an individual than
sentiment. The most active of the analyzed communities shows a particular
structure, in which the inner core of users is qualitatively different from
its periphery in terms of a stronger positive and negative emotional
expression. These results suggest that both objective and subjective aspects
of reviews are relevant to the communication of subjective experience. ",
