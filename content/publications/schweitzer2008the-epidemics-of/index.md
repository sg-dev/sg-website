abstract: This paper demonstrates that collective social dynamics resulting from individual
  donations can be well described by an epidemic model. It captures the herding behavior
  in donations as a non-local interaction between individual via a time-dependent
  mean field representing the mass media. Our study is based on the statistical analysis
  of a unique dataset obtained before and after the tsunami disaster of 2004. We find
  a power-law behavior for the distributions of donations with similar exponents for
  different countries. Even more remarkably, we show that these exponents are the
  same before and after the tsunami, which accounts for some kind of universal behavior
  in donations independent of the actual event. We further show that the time-dependent
  change of both the number and the total amount of donations after the tsunami follows
  a logistic growth equation. As a new element, a time-dependent scaling factor appears
  in this equation which accounts for the growing lack of public interest after the
  disaster. The results of the model are underpinned by the data analysis and thus
  also allow for a quantification of the media influence.
