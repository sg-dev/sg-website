abstract: "We study the collective behavior in a stochastic agent-based model of active\
  \ matter. Provided a critical take-up of energy, agents produce two types of goods\
  \ $x$, $y$ that follow a generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics. For isolated agents,\
  \ production would either reach a fixed point or diverge.  Coupling agents' production\
  \ via a mean field of $x$, however, can lead to synchronized oscillations if agents\
  \ cooperate in the production of $x$. The production of $y$ supports the emergence\
  \ of the synchronized dynamics by suppressing fluctuations and mitigating competition\
  \ between agents, this way stabilizing the production of $x$. We find that in the\
  \ synchronized state different groups of agents coexist, each following their own\
  \ limit cycle. The Kuramoto order parameter is large within groups, and small across\
  \ groups. The collective state is stable against shocks from agents temporarily\
  \ switching between cooperation and competition.   The model dynamics illustrates\
  \ the principles of synergetics, i.e., the spontaneous emergence of order given\
  \ a critical energy supply and cooperative interactions. "
