abstract: Real-world networks are sparse. As we show in this article, even when a
  large number of interactions is observed, most node pairs remain disconnected. We
  demonstrate that classical multiedge network models, such as the G(N,p), configuration
  models, and stochastic block models, fail to accurately capture this phenomenon.
  To mitigate this issue, zero-inflation must be integrated into these traditional
  models. Through zero-inflation, we incorporate a mechanism that accounts for the
  excess number of zeroes (disconnected pairs) observed in empirical data. By performing
  an analysis on all the datasets from the Sociopatterns repository, we illustrate
  how zero-inflated models more accurately reflect the sparsity and heavy-tailed edge
  count distributions observed in empirical data. Our findings underscore that failing
  to account for these ubiquitous properties in real-world networks inadvertently
  leads to biased models that do not accurately represent complex systems and their
  dynamics.
