abstract: The formation of positive and negative relations between individuals 
  in social networks can be described by different approaches. Two prominent 
  mechanisms are structural balance and status hierarchies. Balance motivates 
  stability among friends and enemies in triads (e.g. an enemy of my friend is 
  my enemy). Status considers respect and disregard originating from social 
  hierarchy (e.g. positive relations towards those we respect). We demonstrate 
  that integrating the two mechanisms through the concept of ego dynamics is key
  to understanding observable patterns in many social groups. We propose an 
  agent-based model where dynamical changes result from agents aiming to resolve
  inconsistencies with structural balance and status. In contrast to previous 
  models, our approach employs the ego perspective. Agents have limited, local 
  knowledge and can only change their own relations. By fitting the model to 
  real-world networks, we successfully replicated the observed over- and 
  under-representations of certain triads in 36 empirical signed networks. This 
  close matching to empirical data is achievable only by taking the ego 
  perspective and not assuming global knowledge. Additionally, the model reveals
  that, when the status mechanism dominates, people in real networks tend to 
  strive for the top of the hierarchy. Finally, our numerical simulations and 
  analytic solutions demonstrate that a previously thought as continuous phase 
  transition towards the paradise state (all links positive) can become 
  discontinuous when the status mechanism is involved. This discontinuity 
  indicates that desirable social configurations may, in fact, be quite fragile.
