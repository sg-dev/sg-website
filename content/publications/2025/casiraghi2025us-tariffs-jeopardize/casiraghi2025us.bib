title = {US tariffs jeopardize medicine supply chains},
abstract = {In April, the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on
key trade partners, and it is poised to include pharmaceuticals next.
Tariffs increase input costs for domestic drug manufacturers, particularly
producers of generic medications, who operate on thin margins. 
Moreover, because the US produces only a fraction of the generic
medications that it needs, such drugs could serve as a cheap yet
potent geopolitical tool for retaliation. Rather than expanding tariffs to
pharmaceuticals, the US should build resilience in its medicine supply
chains through targeted investments and international coordination.},
