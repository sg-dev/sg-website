abstract: 'Resilience denotes the capacity of a system to withstand shocks and its
  ability to recover from them. We develop a framework to quantify the resilience
  of highly volatile, non-equilibrium social organizations, such as collectives or
  collaborating teams. It consists of four steps: (i) delimitation, i.e. narrowing
  down the target systems, (ii) conceptualization, i.e. identifying how to approach
  social organizations, (iii) formal representation using a combination of agent-based
  and network models, (iv) operationalization, i.e. specifying measures and demonstrating
  how they enter the calculation of resilience. Our framework quantifies two dimensions
  of resilience, the robustness of social organizations and their adaptivity, and
  combines them in a novel resilience measure. It allows monitoring resilience instantaneously
  using longitudinal data instead of an ex-post evaluation.'
