abstract: Complex software development projects rely on the contribution of teams
  of developers, who are required to collaborate and coordinate their efforts. The
  productivity of such development teams, i.e., how their size is related to the produced
  output, is an important consideration for project and schedule management as well
  as for cost estimation. The majority of studies in empirical software engineering
  suggest that - due to coordination overhead - teams of collaborating developers
  become less productive as they grow in size. This phenomenon is commonly paraphrased
  as Brooks’ law of software project management, which states that “adding manpower
  to a software project makes it later”. Outside software engineering, the non - additive
  scaling of productivity in teams is often referred to as the Ringelmann effect,
  which is studied extensively in social psychology and organizational theory. Conversely,
  a recent study suggested that in Open Source Software (OSS) projects, the productivity
  of developers increases as the team grows in size. Attributing it to collective
  synergetic effects, this surprising finding was linked to the Aristotelian quote
  that “the whole is more than the sum of its parts”. Using a data set of 58 OSS projects
  with more than 580,000 commits contributed by more than 30,000 developers, in this
  article we provide a large - scale analysis of the relation between size and productivity
  of software development teams. Our findings confirm the negative relation between
  team size and productivity previously suggested by empirical software engineering
  research, thus providing quantitative evidence for the presence of a strong Ringelmann
  effect. Using fine - grained data on the association between developers and source
  code files, we investigate possible explanations for the observed relations between
  team size and productivity. In particular, we take a network perspective on developer
  - code associations in software development teams and show that the magnitude of
  the decrease in productivity is likely to be related to the growth dynamics of co
  - editing networks which can be interpreted as a first - order approximation of
  coordination requirements.
