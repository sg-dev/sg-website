abstract: We explore the relationship between human migration and OECD’s Foreign Direct
  Investment(FDI) using a gravity equation enriched with variables that account for
  complex - network effects.Based on a panel data analysis, we find a strong positive
  correlation between the migration networkand the FDI network, which can be mostly
  explained by countries’ economic/demographic sizesand geographical distance. We
  highlight the existence of a stronger positive FDI relationship inpairs of countries
  that are more central in the migration network. Both intensive and extensiveforms
  of centrality are FDI enhancing. Illuminating this result, we show that bilateral
  FDI betweenany two countries is further affected positively by the complex web of
  'third party'corridors/migration stocks of the international migration network.
  Our findings are consistentwhether we consider bilateral FDI and bilateral migration
  figures, or we focus on the outward FDIand the respective inward migration of the
  OECD countries.
