abstract: This paper investigates the process of knowledge exchange in inter-firm
  Research and Development (R&D) alliances by means of an agent-based model. Extant
  research has pointed out that firms select alliance partners considering both network-related
  and network-unrelated features (e.g., social capital versus complementary knowledge
  stocks). In our agent-based model, firms are located in a metric knowledge space.
  The interaction rules incorporate an exploration phase and a knowledge transfer
  phase, during which firms search for a new partner and then evaluate whether they
  can establish an alliance to exchange their knowledge stocks. The model parameters
  determining the overall system properties are the rate at which alliances form and
  dissolve and the agents' interaction radius. Next, we define a novel indicator of
  performance, based on the distance traveled by the firms in the knowledge space.
  Remarkably, we find that - depending on the alliance formation rate and the interaction
  radius - firms tend to cluster around one or more attractors in the knowledge space,
  whose position is an emergent property of the system. And, more importantly, we
  find that there exists an inverted U-shaped dependence of the network performance
  on both model parameters.
