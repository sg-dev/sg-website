abstract: We analyze the controllability of a two-layer network, where driver nodes
  can be chosen randomly only from one layer. Each layer contains a scale-free network
  with directed links and the node dynamics depends on the incoming links from other
  nodes. We combine the in-degree and out-degree values to assign an importance value
  w to each node, and distinguish between peripheral nodes with low w and central
  nodes with high w. Based on numerical simulations, we find that the controllable
  part of the network is larger when choosing low w nodes to connect the two layers.
  The control is as efficient when peripheral nodes are driver nodes as it is for
  the case of more central nodes. However, if we assume a cost to utilize nodes that
  is proportional to their overall degree, utilizing peripheral nodes to connect the
  two layers or to act as driver nodes is not only the most cost-efficient solution,
  it is also the one that performs best in controlling the two-layer network among
  the different interconnecting strategies we have tested.
