abstract: 'Urban structures encompass settlements, characterized by the spatial distribution
  of built-up areas, and also transportation structures, to connect these built-up
  areas. These two structures are very different in their origin and function, fulfilling
  complementary needs: (1) to access space and (2) to occupy space. Their evolution
  cannot be understood by looking at the dynamics of urban aggregations and transportation
  systems separately. Instead, existing built-up areas feed back on the further development
  of transportation structures, and the availability of the latter feeds back on the
  future growth of urban aggregations. To model this co-evolution, we propose an agent-based
  approach that builds on existing agent-based models for the evolution of trail systems
  and urban settlements. The key element in these separate approaches is a generalized
  communication of agents by means of an adaptive landscape. This landscape is only
  generated by the agents, but once it exists, it feeds back on their further actions.
  The emerging trail system or urban aggregation results as a self-organized structure
  from these collective interactions. In our co-evolutionary approach, we couple these
  two separate models by means of meta-agents that represent humans with their different
  demands for housing and mobility. We characterize our approach as a statistical
  ensemble approach, which allows to capture the potential of urban evolution in a
  bottom-up manner, but can be validated against empirical observations.'
