abstract: This volume provides an introduction to and overview of the emerging field
  of interconnected networks which include multilayer or multiplex networks, as well
  as networks of networks. Such networks present structural and dynamical features
  quite different from those observed in isolated networks. The presence of links
  between different networks or layers of a network typically alters the way such
  interconnected networks behave – understanding the role of interconnecting links
  is therefore a crucial step towards a more accurate description of real - world
  systems. While examples of such dissimilar properties are becoming more abundant
  – for example regarding diffusion, robustness and competition – the root of such
  differences remains to be elucidated.Each chapter in this topical collection is
  self - contained and can be read on its own, thus making it also suitable as reference
  for experienced researchers wishing to focus on a particular topic.
