abstract: 'We study the influence of risk diversification on cascading failures in
  weighted complex networks, where weighted directed links represent exposures between
  nodes. These weights result from different diversification strategies and their
  adjustment allows us to reduce systemic risk significantly by topological means.
  As an example, we contrast a classical exposure diversification (ED) approach with
  a damage diversification (DD) variant. The latter reduces the loss that the failure
  of high degree nodes generally inflict to their network neighbors and thus hampers
  the cascade amplification. To quantify the final cascade size and obtain our results,
  we develop a branching process approximation taking into account that inflicted
  losses cannot only depend on properties of the exposed, but also of the failing
  node. This analytic extension is a natural consequence of the paradigm shift from
  individual to system safety. To deepen our understanding of the cascade process,
  we complement this systemic perspective by a mesoscopic one: an analysis of the
  failure risk of nodes dependent on their degree. Additionally, we ask for the role
  of these failures in the cascade amplification.'
