abstract: Recent research on temporal networks has highlighted the limitations of
  a static network perspective for our understanding of complex systems with dynamic
  topologies. In particular, recent works have shown that i) the specific order in
  which links occur in real-world temporal networks affects causality structures and
  thus the evolution of dynamical processes, and ii) higher-order aggregate representations
  of temporal networks can be used to analytically study the effect of these order
  correlations on dynamical processes. In this article we analyze the effect of order
  correlations on path-based centrality measures in real-world temporal networks.
  Analyzing temporal equivalents of betweenness, closeness and reach centrality in
  six empirical temporal networks, we first show that an analysis of the commonly
  used static, time-aggregated representation can give misleading results about the
  actual importance of nodes. We further study higher-order time-aggregated networks,
  a recently proposed generalization of the commonly applied static, time-aggregated
  representation of temporal networks. Here, we particularly define path-based centrality
  measures based on second-order aggregate networks, empirically validating that node
  centralities calculated in this way better capture the true temporal centralities
  of nodes than node centralities calculated based on the commonly used static (first-order)
  representation. Apart from providing a simple and practical method for the approximation
  of path-based centralities in temporal networks, our results highlight interesting
  perspectives for the use of higher-order aggregate networks in the analysis of time-stamped
  network data.
