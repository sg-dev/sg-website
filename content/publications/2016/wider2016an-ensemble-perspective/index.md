abstract: We study properties of multi-layered, interconnected networks from an ensemble
  perspective, i.e. we analyze ensembles of multi-layer networks that share similar
  aggregate characteristics. Using a diffusive process that evolves on a multi-layer
  network, we analyze how the speed of diffusion depends on the aggregate characteristics
  of both intra- and inter-layer connectivity. Through a block-matrix model representing
  the distinct layers, we construct transition matrices of random walkers on multi-layer
  networks, and estimate expected properties of multi-layer networks using a mean-field
  approach. In addition, we quantify and explore conditions on the link topology that
  allow to estimate the ensemble average by only considering aggregate statistics
  of the layers. Our approach can be used when only partial information is available,
  like it is usually the case for real-world multi-layer complex systems.
