abstract: 'Statistical ensembles define probability spaces of all networks consistent
  with given aggregate statistics and have become instrumental in the analysis of
  relational data on networked systems. Their numerical and analytical study provides
  the foundation for the inference of topological patterns, the definition of network-analytic
  measures, as well as for model selection and statistical hypothesis testing. Contributing
  to the foundation of these important data science techniques, in this article we
  introduce generalized hypergeometric ensembles, a framework of analytically tractable
  statistical ensembles of finite, directed and weighted networks. This framework
  can be interpreted as a generalization of the classical configuration model, which
  is commonly used to randomly generate networks with a given degree sequence or distribution.
  Our generalization rests on the introduction of dyadic link propensities, which
  capture the degree-corrected tendencies of pairs of nodes to form edges between
  each other. Studying empirical and synthetic data, we show that our approach provides
  broad perspectives for community detection, model selection and statistical hypothesis
  testing. '
