abstract: We study cascades on a two-layer multiplex network, with asymmetric feedback
  that depends on the coupling strength between the layers. Based on an analytical
  branching process approximation, we calculate the systemic risk measured by the
  final fraction of failed nodes on a reference layer. The results are compared with
  the case of a single layer network that is an aggregated representation of the two
  layers. We find that systemic risk in the two-layer network is smaller than in the
  aggregated one only if the coupling strength between the two layers is small. Above
  a critical coupling strength, systemic risk is increased because of the mutual amplification
  of cascades in the two layers. We even observe sharp phase transitions in the cascade
  size that are less pronounced on the aggregated layer. Our insights can be applied
  to a scenario where firms decide whether they want to split their business into
  a less risky core business and a more risky subsidiary business. In most cases,
  this may lead to a drastic increase of systemic risk, which is underestimated in
  an aggregated approach.
