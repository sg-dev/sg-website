abstract: Drawing on a large database of publicly announced R&D alliances, we empirically
  investigate the evolution of R&D networks and the process of alliance formation
  in several manufacturing sectors over a 24-year period (1986-2009). Our goal is
  to empirically evaluate the temporal and sectoral robustness of a large set of network
  indicators, thus providing a more complete description of R&D networks with respect
  to the existing literature. We find that most network properties are not only invariant
  across sectors, but also independent of the scale of aggregation at which they are
  observed, and we highlight the presence of core-periphery architectures in explaining
  some properties emphasized in previous empirical studies (e.g. asymmetric degree
  distributions and small worlds). In addition, we show that many properties of R&D
  networks are characterized by a rise-and-fall dynamics with a peak in the mid-nineties.
  We find that such dynamics is driven by mechanisms of accumulative advantage, structural
  homophily and multiconnectivity. In particular, the change from the \"rise\" to
  the \"fall\" phase is associated to a structural break in the importance of multiconnectivity.
