abstract: The social connections, or ties, individuals create affect their life outcomes,
  for example, by providing novel information that leads to new jobs or career opportunities.
  A host of socioeconomic and cognitive factors are believed to affect social interactions,
  but few of these factors have been empirically validated. In this research work,
  we extracted a large corpus of data from a popular social media platform that consists
  of geo-referenced messages, or tweets, posted from a major US metropolitan area.
  We linked these tweets to US Census data through their locations. This allowed us
  to measure emotions expressed in tweets posted from a specific area, and also use
  that area's socioeconomic and demographic characteristics in the analysis. We extracted
  the structure of social interactions from the people mentioned in tweets from that
  area. We find that at an aggregate level, areas where social media users engage
  in stronger, less diverse online social interactions are those where they express
  more negative emotions, like sadness and anger. With respect to demographics, these
  areas have larger numbers of Hispanic residents, lower mean household income, and
  lower education levels. Conversely, areas with weaker, more diverse online interactions
  are associated with happier, more positive feelings and also have better educated,
  younger and higher-earning residents. Our work highlights the value of linking social
  media data to traditional data sources, such as US Census, to drive novel analysis
  of online behavior.
