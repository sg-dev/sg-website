abstract: Through the analysis of collective upvotes and downvotes in multiple social
  media, we discover the bimodal regime of collective evaluations. When online content
  surpasses the local social context by reaching a threshold of collective attention,
  negativity grows faster with positivity, which serves as a trace of the burst of
  a filter bubble. To attain a global audience, we show that emotions expressed in
  online content has a significant effect and also play a key role in creating polarized
  opinions.
