abstract: We develop a dynamic network formation model that can explain the observed
  nestedness in real - world networks. Links are formed on the basis of agentsâ€™ centrality
  and have an exponentially distributed life time. We use stochastic stability to
  identify the networks to which the network formation process converges and find
  that they are nested split graphs. We completely determine the topological properties
  of the stochastically stable networks and show that they match features exhibited
  by real - world networks. Using four different network datasets, we empirically
  test our model and show that it fits well the observed networks.
