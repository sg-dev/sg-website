abstract: Non-verbal communication (NVC) makes up about two-thirds of all communication
  between two people or between one speaker and a group of listeners. However, this
  fundamental aspect of communicating is mostly omitted in 3D social forums or virtual
  world oriented games. This paper proposes an answer by presenting a multi-user 3D-chatting
  system enriched with NVC relative to motion. This event-based  architecture tries
  to recreate a context by extracting emotional cues from dialogs and derives virtual
  human potential body expressions from that event triggered context model. We structure
  the paper by expounding the system architecture enabling the modeling NVC in a multi-user
  3D-chatting environment. There, we present the transition from dialog-based emotional
  cues to body language, and the management of NVC events in the context of a virtual
  reality client-server system. Finally, we illustrate the results with graphical
  scenes and a statistical analysis representing the increase of events due to NVC.
