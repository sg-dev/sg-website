abstract: Models of opinion formation are used to investigate many collective phenomena.
  While social influence often constitutes a basic mechanism, its implementation differs
  between the models. In this paper, we provide a general framework of social influence
  inspired by the social psychological concept of cognitive dissonance.We only premise
  that individuals strive to minimize dissonance resulting from different opinions
  compared to neighbor individuals in a given social network. Within a game theoretic
  context, we show that our concept of dissonance reduction exhibits the basic properties
  of a coordination process. We further show that different models of opinion formation
  can be represented as best response dynamics within our general framework. Thus,
  we offer a unifying perspective on heterogeneous models and link them to rational
  choice theory.
