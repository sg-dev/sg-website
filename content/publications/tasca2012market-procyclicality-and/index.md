abstract: We model the systemic risk associated with the so - called balance - sheet
  ampliﬁcation mechanism in a system of banks with interlocked balance sheets and
  with positions in real - economy - related assets. Our modeling framework integrates
  a stochastic price dynamics with an active balance - sheet management aimed to maintain
  the Value - at - Risk at a target level. We ﬁnd that a strong compliance with capital
  requirements, usually alleged to be procyclical, does not increase systemic risk
  unless the asset market is illiquid. Conversely, when the asset market is illiquid,
  even a weak compliance with capital requirements increases signiﬁcantly systemic
  risk. Our ﬁndings have implications in terms of possible macro - prudential policies
  to mitigate systemic risk.
