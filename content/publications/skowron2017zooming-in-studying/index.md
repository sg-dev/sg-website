abstract: Computer - mediated communication between humans is at the center of the
  formation of collective emotions on the Internet. This chapter presents how interactive
  affective systems can be applied in order to study the role of emotion in online
  communication at the micro - scale, i.e. between individual users or between users
  and artificial communication partners. Specifically, we report on the effect of
  a simulated conversational partnerâ€™s affective profile, the use of fine - grained
  communication scenarios and social interaction context on changes in emotional states
  and expressed affect of users as well as their communication patterns. Based on
  these findings, we propose applications for such systems focused on supporting different
  e - communities with real - time information and discuss ethical implications of
  such systems.
