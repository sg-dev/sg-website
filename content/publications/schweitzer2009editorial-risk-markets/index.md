abstract: 'The 20 research articles collected in this issue share, in addition to
  their topical relations, one important feature: they present results obtained from
  research groups associated in the COST action P10 ‘Physics of Risk’. COST is an
  intergovernmental framework for ‘European Cooperation in Science and Technology’,
  allowing the coordination of research on a European level. The action P10 was funded
  between September 2003 and June 2008 and involved more than 80 scientists in 21
  countries across Europe. The main objective of the action was to apply methods developed
  in statistical physics to accomplish a new quantitative understanding of the assessment
  of risk. This way it departed from usual activities in the ﬁeld of risk management.
  In fact, in recent years statistical physics has successfully contributed to many
  interdisciplinary ﬁelds ranging from regulatory networks in biology to ﬁnancial
  market models. Therefore, a transfer of methods and tools from statistical physics
  into the area of risk assessment should be a promising endeavour.'
