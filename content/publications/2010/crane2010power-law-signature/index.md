abstract: We study the humanitarian response to the destruction brought by the tsunami
  generated by the Sumatra earthquake of December 26, 2004, as measured by donations,
  and find that it decays in time as a power law ~ 1/t^(alpha) with alpha = 2.5 +
  /-0.1. This behavior is suggested to be the rare outcome of a priority queuing process
  in which individuals execute tasks at a rate slightly faster than the rate at which
  new tasks arise. We believe this to be the first empirical evidence documenting
  this recently predicted regime, and provide additional independent evidence that
  suggests it arises as a result of the intense focus placed on this donation \"task\"
  by the media.
