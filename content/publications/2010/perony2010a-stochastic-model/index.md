abstract: We investigate to what extent the interaction dynamics of a population of
  wild house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) in their environment can be explained
  by a simple stochastic model. We use a Markov chain model to describe the transitions
  of mice in a discrete space of nestboxes, and implement a multi-agent simulation
  of the model. We find that some important features of our behavioural dataset can
  be reproduced using this simplified stochastic representation, and discuss the improvements
  that could be made to our model in order to increase the accuracy of its predictions.
  Our findings have implications for the understanding of the complexity underlying
  social behaviour in the animal kingdom and the cognitive requirements of such behaviour.
