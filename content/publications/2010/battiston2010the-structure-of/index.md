abstract: We present here an overview of the use of networks in Finance and Economics.
  We show how this approach enables us to address important questions as, for example,
  the structure of control chains in financial systems, the systemic risk associated
  with them and the evolution of trade between nations. All these results are new
  in the field and allow for a better understanding and modelling of different economic
  systems.
