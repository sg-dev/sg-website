abstract: We develop an agent - based framework to model the emergence of collective
  emotions, which is applied to online communities. Agent’s individual emotions are
  described by their valence and arousal. Using the concept of Brownian agents, these
  variables change according to a stochastic dynamics, which also considers the feedback
  from online communication. Agents generate emotional information, which is stored
  and distributed in a field modeling the online medium. This field affects the emotional
  states of agents in a non - linearmanner.We derive conditions for the emergence
  of collective emotions, observable in a bimodal valence distribution. Dependent
  on a saturated or a superlinear feedback between the information field and the agent’s
  arousal, we further identify scenarios where collective emotions only appear once
  or in a repeated manner. The analytical results are illustrated by agent - based
  computer simulations. Our framework provides testable hypotheses about the emergence
  of collective emotions, which can be verified by data from online communities.
