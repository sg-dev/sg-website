abstract: A new theorem on conditions for convergence to consensus of a multiagent
  time-dependent time-discrete dynamical system is presented. The theorem is build
  up on the notion of averaging maps. We compare this theorem to results by Moreau
  (IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, vol. 50, no. 2, 2005) about set-valued
  Lyapunov theory and convergence under switching communication topologies. We give
  examples that point out differences of approaches including examples where Moreau's
  theorem is not applicable but ours is. Further on, we give examples that demonstrate
  that the theory of convergence to consensus is still not complete.
