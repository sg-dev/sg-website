abstract: Controllability, a basic property of various networked systems, has gained
  profound theoretical applications in complex social, technological, biological,
  and brain networks. Yet, little attention has been given to the control trajectory
  (route), along which a controllable system can be controlled from any initial to
  any final state, hampering the implementation of practical control. Here we systematically
  uncover the fundamental relations between control trajectory and several other key
  factors, such as the control distance between initial and final states ($δ$), number
  of driver nodes, and the control time. The length ($mathcalL$) and maximum distance
  to the initial state ($mathcalR$) are employed to quantify the locality and globality
  of control trajectories. We analyze how the scaling behavior of the averaged $mathcalL$
  and $mathcalR$ changes with increasing $δ$ for different initial states. After showing
  the scaling behavior for each trajectory, we also provide the distributions of $mathcalL$
  and $mathcalR$. Further attention is given to the control time $t_f$ and its influence
  on $mathcalL$ and $mathcalR$. Our results provide comprehensive insights in understanding
  control trajectories for complex networks, and pave the way to achieve practical
  control in various real systems.
