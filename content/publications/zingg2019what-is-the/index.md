abstract: We quantify a social organization's potentiality, that is its ability to
  attain different configurations. The organization is represented as a network in
  which nodes correspond to individuals and (multi-)edges to their multiple interactions.
  Attainable configurations are treated as realizations from a network ensemble. To
  encode interaction preferences between individuals, we choose the generalized hypergeometric
  ensemble of random graphs, which is described by a closed-form probability distribution.
  From this distribution we calculate Shannon entropy as a measure of potentiality.
  This allows us to compare different organizations as well different stages in the
  development of a given organization. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated
  using data from 3 empirical and 2 synthetic systems.
