abstract: 'We develop a model of innovation communities which allows us to address
  in a systematic way the influence of users and developers as well as communication
  between and within these groups. Based on this model, we derive a formal approach
  to quantify communication flows, community activity and community turnover. These
  measures are calculated using the data of 100 open source software projects. Our
  empirical analysis shows that: (i) Users play indeed a predominant role in communication,
  which points towards the vivid role of an active user community; (ii) communication
  is highly concentrated, which points towards the importance of active individuals
  and (iii) community turnover exhibits only little correlation with community segregation,
  which may allow to benefit from high turnover rates while keeping negative effects
  small. We argue that insight from this extensive analysis not only complements existing
  case studies, it also provides a reference frame to put these singular results into
  perspective when aiming at generalizations.'
