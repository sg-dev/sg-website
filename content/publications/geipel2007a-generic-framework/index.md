abstract: Past years have witnessed a growing interest in automated negotiation as
  a coordination mechanism for interacting agents. This paper presents a generic,
  problem-and domain-independent frame-work for argumentation-based negotiation that
  covers both essential agent-internal and external components relevant to automated
  negotia-tion. This framework, called Negotiation Situation Specification Scheme
  (N3S), is both suited as a guideline for implementing negotiation sce-narios as
  well as integrating available approaches that address selective aspects of negotiation.
  In particular, N3S contributes to the state of the art in automated negotiation
  by identifying and relating basic argument types and negotiation stages in a structured
  and formal way.
