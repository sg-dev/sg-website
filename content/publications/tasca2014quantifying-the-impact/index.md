abstract: 'The excessive increase of leverage, i.e. the abuse of debt financing, is
  considered one of the primary factors in the default of financial institutions since
  it amplifies potential investment losses. On the other side, portfolio diversification
  acts to mitigate these losses. Systemic risk results from correlations between individual
  default probabilities that cannot be considered independent. Based on the structural
  framework by Merton (1974), we propose a model in which these correlations arise
  from overlaps in banksâ€™ portfolios. Our main result is the finding of a critical
  level of diversification that separates two regimes: (i) a safe regime in which
  a properly chosen diversification strategy offsets the higher systemic risk engendered
  by increased leverage and (ii) a risky regime in which an inadequate diversification
  strategy and/or adverse market conditions, such as market size, market volatility
  and time horizon, cannot compensate the same increase in leverage. Our results are
  of relevance for financial regulators especially because the critical level of diversification
  may not coincide with the one that is individually optimal.'
