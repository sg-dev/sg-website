abstract: When exploring the structure and function of such complex systems, the visualization
  of network topologies has become a standard technique. Many - if not most - of the
  systems being considered are inherently dynamic and in recent years more and more
  data on their dynamics are becoming available in the form of so-called temporal
  networks. We propose a simple mechanism that can be used to include temporal correlations
  present in longitudinal data on temporal networks in the layout of time-aggregated
  network structures. We particularly focus on non-Markovian properties of contact
  sequences in temporal networks, i.e. the fact that future contacts not only depend
  on the current contact, but also on past contacts. We demonstrate our approach by
  visualising a set of examples for temporal networks with non-Markovian properties.
  The visualisations show that the resulting visualizations reveal important aspects
  like e.g. community structures of the dynamics which - although present in empirical
  data sets - a) are not represented in static, aggregate networks and b) cannot easily
  be seen even in dynamic visualizations of temporal networks.
