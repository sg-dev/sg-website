abstract: This paper shows that the available stylized facts on productivity dynamics,
  such as persistent cross-sectoral heterogeneity, do not allow to solve an identification
  problem regarding the impact of common drivers-such as General Purpose Technologies
  (GPTs)-on economic growth. The evidence of persistently heterogeneous productivity
  performances is consistent both with a GPT-driven model, and with a model characterized
  by purely independent and idiosyncratic sectoral dynamics. These results are obtained
  within a simple theoretical framework, and illustrated with reference to measures
  of concentration of the sectoral contributions to aggregate total factor productivity
  growth.
