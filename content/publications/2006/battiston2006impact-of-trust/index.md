abstract: Social agents naturally use their social and professional networks to filter
  information by trustworthiness. In this paper, we present a model of an automated
  distributed recom- mendation system on a social network and we investigate how the
  dynamics of trust among agents affect the performance of the system. Agents search
  their social network for recom- mendations on items to be consumed and the propagation
  of the query through agents at several degrees of separation enhances the efficiency
  of their search. Moreover, agents have heterogeneous preferences so that trust between
  neighbours can be used to filter information coming from remote agents. We identify
  the range of the density of the network and the degree of heterogeneity of agent
  preferences in which trust improves the performance of the recommendation system.
