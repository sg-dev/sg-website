abstract: In this Chap. we analyse an agent - based model designed to understand the
  dynamics of the intergenerational transmission of age - at - marriage norms. A norm
  in this context is an acceptable age interval to get married. We assume that this
  age - interval is defined at the individual level and the individualsâ€™ age - at
  - marriage norms are transmitted from parents to their children. We compare four
  different transmission mechanisms to investigate the long term persistence or disappearance
  of norms under different regimes of transmission. Our work is an extension of [4]
  that introduces a one - sex non - overlapping - generations version of an age -
  at - marriage model. Here we investigate whether their results also hold in a more
  complex setup. Therefore, we explicitly take into account heterogeneity with respect
  to age and sex. Moreover, we also include the timing of union formation and fertility
  into our model. To create a more realistic model of the evolution of age norms the
  characteristics of the agents are extended, some new parameters are added to the
  model and the age - at - marriage norms are split into two sex - specific age -
  at - marriage norms. A comparison of the results with those of the original model
  gives information about how additional characteristics and new parameters can influence
  the evolution of age - at - marriage norms.
