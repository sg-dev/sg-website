abstract: Online social networks (OSN) are prime examples of socio-technical systems
  in which individuals interact via a technical platform. OSN are very volatile because
  users enter and exit and frequently change their interactions. This makes the robustness
  of such systems difficult to measure and to control. To quantify robustness, we
  propose a coreness value obtained from the directed interaction network. We study
  the emergence of large drop-out cascades of users leaving the OSN by means of an
  agent-based model. For agents, we define a utility function that depends on their
  relative reputation and their costs for interactions. The decision of agents to
  leave the OSN depends on this utility. Our aim is to prevent drop-out cascades by
  influencing specific agents with low utility. We identify strategies to control
  agents in the core and the periphery of the OSN such that drop-out cascades are
  significantly reduced, and the robustness of the OSN is increased.
