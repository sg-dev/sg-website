abstract: 'Systems design utilizes top-down and bottom-up approaches to influence
  social or economic systems such that a desired outcome is obtained.  We characterize
  different approaches, such as network controllability, network interventions, nudging
  and mechanism design, and discuss the problems involved.  We argue that systems
  design cannot be reduced to solving complex optimization problems. '
