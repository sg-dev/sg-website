abstract: We propose a novel sequence prediction method for sequential data capturing
  node traversals in graphs. Our method builds on a statistical modelling framework
  that combines multiple higher-order network models into a single multi-order model.
  We develop a technique to fit such multi-order models in empirical sequential data
  and to select the optimal maximum order. Our framework facilitates both next-element
  and full sequence prediction given a sequence-prefix of any length. We evaluate
  our model based on six empirical data sets containing sequences from website navigation
  as well as public transport systems. The results show that our method out-performs
  state-of-the-art algorithms for next-element prediction. We further demonstrate
  the accuracy of our method during out-of-sample sequence prediction and validate
  that our method can scale to data sets with millions of sequences.
