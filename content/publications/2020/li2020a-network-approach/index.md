abstract: " With the increasing availability of online scholarly databases, publication\
  \ records can be easily extracted and analysed. Researchers can promptly keep abreast\
  \ of others' scientific production and, in principle, can select new collaborators\
  \ and build new research teams. A critical factor one should consider when contemplating\
  \ new potential collaborations is the possibility of unambiguously defining the\
  \ expertise of other researchers. While some organisations have established database\
  \ systems to enable their members to manually produce a profile, maintaining such\
  \ systems is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, there has been a growing interest\
  \ in retrieving expertise through automated approaches. Indeed, the identification\
  \ of researchers' expertise is of great value in many applications, such as identifying\
  \ qualified experts to supervise new researchers, assigning manuscripts to reviewers,\
  \ and forming a qualified team. Here, we propose a network-based approach to the\
  \ construction of authors' expertise profiles. Using the MEDLINE corpus as an example,\
  \ we show that our method can be applied to a number of widely used data sets and\
  \ outperforms other methods traditionally used for expertise identification. "
