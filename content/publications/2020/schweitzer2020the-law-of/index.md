abstract: The law of proportionate growth simply states that the time dependent change
  of a quantity $x$ is proportional to $x$.   Its applicability to a wide range of
  dynamic phenomena is based on various assumptions for the proportionality factor,
  which can be random or deterministic, constant or time dependent.   Further, the
  dynamics can be combined with additional additive growth terms, which can be constants,
  aggregated quantities, or interaction terms.   This allows to extent the core dynamics
  into an agent-based modeling framework with vast applications in social and economic
  systems.   The paper adopts this overarching perspective to discuss phenomena as
  diverse as saturated growth, competition, stochastic growth, investments in random
  environments, wealth redistribution, opinion dynamics and the wisdom of crowds,
  reputation dynamics, knowledge growth, and the combination with network dynamics.
