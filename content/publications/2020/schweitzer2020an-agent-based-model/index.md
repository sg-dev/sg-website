abstract: We provide an agent-based model to explain the emergence of collective opinions
  not based on feedback between different opinions, but based on emotional interactions
  between agents. The driving variable is the emotional state of agents, characterized
  by their valence, quantifying the emotion from unpleasant to pleasant, and their
  arousal, quantifying the degree of activity associated with the emotion. Both determine
  their emotional expression, from which collective emotional information is generated.
  This information feeds back on the dynamics of emotional states and individual opinions
  in a nonlinear manner. We derive the critical conditions for emotional interactions
  to obtain either consensus or polarization of opinions. Stochastic agent-based simulations
  and formal analyses of the model explain our results. Possible ways to validate
  the model are discussed.
