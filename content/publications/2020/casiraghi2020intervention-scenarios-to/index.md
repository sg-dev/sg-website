abstract: We investigate a multi-agent model of firms in a Research & Development
  (R&D) network. Each firm is characterized by its knowledge stock xi(t), which follows
  a non-linear dynamics. xi(t) grows with the input from other firms, i.e., by knowledge
  transfer, and decays otherwise. However, maintaining the interactions that increase
  knowledge stock is costly for all partners involved. Because of this, firms leave
  the network whenever their expected knowledge growth is not realized. This, in turn,
  may cause other firms also to leave the network. The paper discusses two bottom-up
  intervention scenarios to prevent, reduce, or delay such cascades of firms leaving.
  The first one is based on the formalism of network controllability, in which driver
  nodes are identified and subsequently incentivized, by reducing their costs. The
  second one combines node interventions and network interventions. It proposes the
  controlled removal of a single firm and the random replacement of firms leaving.
  This allows to generate small cascades, which prevents the occurrence of large cascades.
  We find that both approaches successfully mitigate cascades and thus improve the
  resilience of the R&D network.
