abstract: We provide a general framework to model the growth of networks consisting
  of different coupled layers. Our aim is to estimate the impact of one such layer
  on the dynamics of the others. As an application, we study a scientometric network,
  where one layer consists of publications as nodes and citations as links, whereas
  the second layer represents the authors. This allows us to address the question
  of how characteristics of authors, such as their number of publications or number
  of previous coauthors, impacts the citation dynamics of a new publication. To test
  different hypotheses about this impact, our model combines citation constituents
  and social constituents in different ways. We then evaluate their performance in
  reproducing the citation dynamics in nine different physics journals. For this,
  we develop a general method for statistical parameter estimation and model selection
  that is applicable to growing multilayer networks. It takes both the parameter errors
  and the model complexity into account and is computationally efficient and scalable
  to large networks.
