abstract: We provide a general framework to model the growth of networks consisting
  of different coupled layers. Our aim is to estimate the impact of one such layer
  on the dynamics of the others. As an application, we study a scientometric network,
  where one layer consists of publications as nodes and citations as links, whereas
  the second layer represents the authors. This allows to address the question how
  characteristics of authors, such as their number of publications or number of previous
  co-authors, impacts the citation dynamics of a new publication. To test different
  hypotheses about this impact, our model combines citation constituents and social
  constituents in different ways. We then evaluate their performance in reproducing
  the citation dynamics in nine different physics journals. For this, we develop a
  general method for statistical parameter estimation and model selection that is
  applicable to growing multi-layer networks. It takes both the parameter errors and
  the model complexity into account and is computationally efficient and scalable
  to large networks.
