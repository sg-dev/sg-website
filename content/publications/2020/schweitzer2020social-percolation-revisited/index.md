abstract: The social percolation model (Solomon et al., 2000) considers a 2-dimensional
  regular lattice. Each site is occupied by an agent with a preference $x_i$ sampled
  from a uniform distribution $U[0,1]$. Agents transfer the information about the
  quality $q$ of a movie to their neighbors only if $x_i≈Çeq q$.  Information percolates
  through the lattice if $q=q_c=0.593$. --  From a network perspective the percolating
  cluster can be seen as a random-regular network with $n_c$ nodes and a mean degree
  that depends on $q_c$.  Preserving these quantities of the random-regular network,
  a true random network can be generated from the $G(n,p)$ model after determining
  the link probability $p$.  I then demonstrate how this random network can be transformed
  into a threshold network, where agents create links dependent on their $x_i$ values.   Assuming
  a dynamics of the $x_i$ and a mechanism of group formation, I further extend the
  model toward an adaptive social network model.
