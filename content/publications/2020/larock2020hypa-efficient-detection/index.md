abstract: The unsupervised detection of anomalies in time series data has important
  applications in user behavioral modeling, fraud detection, and cybersecurity. Anomaly
  detection has, in fact, been extensively studied in categorical sequences. However,
  we often have access to time series data that represent paths through networks.
  Examples include transaction sequences in financial networks, click streams of users
  in networks of cross-referenced documents, or travel itineraries in transportation
  networks. To reliably detect anomalies, we must account for the fact that such data
  contain a large number of independent observations of paths constrained by a graph
  topology. Moreover, the heterogeneity of real systems rules out frequency-based
  anomaly detection techniques, which do not account for highly skewed edge and degree
  statistics. To address this problem, we introduce HYPA, a novel framework for the
  unsupervised detection of anomalies in large corpora of variable-length temporal
  paths in a graph. HYPA provides an efficient analytical method to detect paths with
  anomalous frequencies that result from nodes being traversed in unexpected chronological
  order.
