abstract: We analyze an agent-based model to estimate how the costs and benefits of
  users in an online social network (OSN) impact the robustness of the OSN. Benefits
  are measured in terms of relative reputation that users receives from their followers.
  They can be increased by direct and indirect reciprocity in following each other,
  which leads to a core-periphery structure of the OSN. Costs relate to the effort
  to login, to maintain the profile, etc. and are assumed as constant for all users.
  The robustness of the OSN depends on the entry and exit of users over time. Intuitively,
  one would expect that higher costs lead to more users leaving and hence to a less
  robust OSN. We demonstrate that an optimal cost level exists, which maximizes both
  the performance of the OSN, measured by means of the long-term average benefit of
  its users, and the robustness of the OSN, measured by means of the life-time of
  the core of the OSN. Our mathematical and computational analyses unfold how changes
  in the cost level impact reciprocity and subsequently the core-periphery structure
  of the OSN, to explain the optimal cost level.
