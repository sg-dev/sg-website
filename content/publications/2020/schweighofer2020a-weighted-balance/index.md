abstract: Polarization is threatening the stability of democratic societies. Until
  now, polarization research has focused on opinion extremeness, overlooking the correlation
  between different policy issues. We explain the emergence of hyperpolarization,
  i.e. the combination of extremeness and correlation between issues, by developing
  Weighted Balance Theory (WBT), a new theory of opinion formation. WBT extends Heiderâ€™s
  cognitive balance theory to encompass multiple weighted attitudes. We validate WBT
  on empirical data from the 2016 National Election Survey. Furthermore, we develop
  an opinion dynamics model based on WBT, which, for the first time, is able to generate
  hyperpolarization and to explain the link between affective and opinion polarization.
  In addition, our theory encompasses other phenomena of opinion dynamics, including
  mono - polarization and backfire effects.
