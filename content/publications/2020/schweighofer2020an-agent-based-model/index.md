abstract: It is known that individual opinions on different policy issues often align
  to a dominant ideological dimension (e.g. ``left'' vs. ``right'') and become increasingly
  polarized.  We provide an agent-based model that reproduces these two stylized facts
  as emergent properties of an opinion dynamics in a  multi-dimensional space of continuous
  opinions.  The mechanisms for the change of agents' opinions in this multi-dimensional
  space are derived from cognitive dissonance theory and structural balance theory.  We
  test assumptions from proximity voting and from directional voting regarding their
  ability to reproduce the expected emerging properties.  We further study how the
  emotional involvement of agents, i.e. their individual resistance to change opinions,
  impacts the dynamics.  We identify two regimes for the global and the individual
  alignment of opinions.  If the affective involvement is high and shows a large variance
  across agents, this fosters the emergence of a dominant ideological dimension.     Agents
  align their opinions along this dimension in opposite directions, i.e. create a
  state of polarization.
