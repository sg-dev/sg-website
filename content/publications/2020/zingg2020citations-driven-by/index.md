abstract: To what extent is the citation rate of new papers influenced by the past
  social relations of their authors? To answer this question, we present a data-driven
  analysis of nine different physics journals. Our analysis is based on a two-layer
  network representation constructed from two large-scale data sets, INSPIREHEP and
  APS. The social layer contains authors as nodes and coauthorship relations as links.
  This allows us to quantify the social relations of each author, prior to the publication
  of a new paper. The publication layer contains papers as nodes and citations between
  papers as links. This layer allows us to quantify scientific attention as measured
  by the change of the citation rate over time. We particularly study how this change
  correlates with the social relations of their authors, prior to publication. We
  find that on average the maximum value of the citation rate is reached sooner for
  authors who have either published more papers or who have had more coauthors in
  previous papers. We also find that for these authors the decay in the citation rate
  is faster, meaning that their papers are forgotten sooner.
