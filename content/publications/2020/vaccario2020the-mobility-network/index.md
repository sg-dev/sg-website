abstract: The mobility of scientists between different universities and countries
  is important to foster knowledge exchange. At the same time, the potential mobility
  is restricted by geographic and institutional constraints, which leads to temporal
  correlations in the career trajectories of scientists. To quantify this effect,
  we extract 3.5 million career trajectories of scientists from two large scale bibliographic
  data sets and analyze them applying a novel method of higher-order networks. We
  study the effect of temporal correlations at three different levels of aggregation,
  universities, cities and countries. We find strong evidence for such correlations
  for the top 100 universities, i.e. scientists move likely between specific institutions.
  These correlations also exist at the level of countries, but cannot be found for
  cities. Our results allow to draw conclusions about the institutional path dependence
  of scientific careers and the efficiency of mobility programs.
