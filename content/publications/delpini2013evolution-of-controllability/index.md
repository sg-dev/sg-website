abstract: The Statistical Physics of Complex Networks has recently provided new theoretical
  tools for policy makers. Here we extend the notion of network controllability to
  detect the financial institutions, i.e. the drivers, that are most crucial to the
  functioning of an interbank market. The system we investigate is a paradigmatic
  case study for complex networks since it undergoes dramatic structural changes over
  time and links among nodes can be observed at several time scales. We find a scale-free
  decay of the fraction of drivers with increasing time resolution, implying that
  policies have to be adjusted to the time scales in order to be effective. Moreover,
  drivers are often not the most highly connected \"hub\" institutions, nor the largest
  lenders, contrary to the results of other studies. Our findings contribute quantitative
  indicators which can support regulators in developing more effective supervision
  and intervention policies.
