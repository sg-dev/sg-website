abstract: The agent concept is one of the very few concepts which have been able to
  cross the borders of scientiﬁc disciplines, ﬁnding applications not only in computer
  science and artiﬁcial intelligence, but also in biology, economics, engineering,
  and the social sciences. Thus it is only natural that the research frontiers in
  this fast growing ﬁeld develop along interdisciplinary problems. These include the
  ability of agents to evolve, e.g. through adaptation and learning, but also the
  emergence of systemic properties which result from the interplay of large numbers
  of agents, rather than from carefully designed single agent behavior.
