abstract: We present an agent-based computational model in which bounded rational
  firms and workers trade on fully decentralized markets for final goods and labor
  by means of random matching protocols. The model replicates several macroeconomic
  phenomena regularly observed in the data, with aggregate features emerging from
  the localized interactions of individual entities. The model is then used as a computational
  laboratory to run an experiment on the role of fiscal policy in increasing macroeconomic
  performance.
