abstract: 'In nonlinear voter models the transitions between two states depend in
  a nonlinear manner on the frequencies of these states in the neighborhood. We investigate
  the role of these nonlinearities on the global outcome of the dynamics for a homogeneous
  network where each node is connected to $m = 4$ neighbors. The paper unfolds in
  two directions. We first develop a general stochastic framework for frequency dependent
  processes from which we derive the macroscopic dynamics for key variables, such
  as global frequencies and correlations. Explicite expressions for both the mean-field
  limit and the pair approximation are obtained. We then apply these equations to
  determine a phase diagram in the parameter space that distinguishes between different
  dynamic regimes. The pair approximation allows us to identify three regimes for
  nonlinear voter models: (i) complete invasion, (ii) random coexistence, and-- most
  interestingly-- (iii) correlated coexistence. These findings are contrasted with
  predictions from the mean-field phase diagram and are confirmed by extensive computer
  simulations of the microscopic dynamics.'
