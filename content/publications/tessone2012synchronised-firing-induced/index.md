abstract: We study the collective dynamics of an ensemble of coupled identical FitzHugh-Nagumo
  elements in their excitable regime. We show that collective firing, where all the
  elements perform their individual firing cycle synchronously, can be induced by
  random changes in the interaction pattern. Specifically, on a sparse evolving network
  where, at any time, each element is connected with at most one partner, collective
  firing occurs for intermediate values of the rewiring frequency. Thus, network dynamics
  can play the role of noise and connectivity in inducing this kind of self-organised
  behaviour in highly disconnected systems which, otherwise, would not allow for the
  spreading of coherent evolution.
