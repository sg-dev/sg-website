abstract: "Leading-following behaviour in Bechstein's bats transfers information about\
  \ suitable roost sites from experienced to inexperienced individuals, and thus ensures\
  \ communal roosting. We analyze 9 empirical data sets about individualized leading-following\
  \ (L/F) events, to infer rules that likely determine the formation of L/F pairs.\
  \ To test these rules, we propose five models that differ regarding the empirical\
  \ information taken into account to form L/F pairs: activity of a bat in exploring\
  \ possible roosts, tendency to lead and to follow. The comparison with empirical\
  \ data was done by constructing social networks from the observed L/F events, on\
  \ which centralities were calculated to quantify the importance of individuals in\
  \ these L/F networks. The centralities from the empirical network are then compared\
  \ for statistical differences with the model-generated centralities obtained from\
  \ $10^5$ model realizations. We find that two models perform well in comparison\
  \ with the empirical data: One model assumes an individual tendency to lead, but\
  \ chooses followers at random. The other model assumes an individual tendency to\
  \ follow and chooses leaders according to their overall activity. We note that neither\
  \ individual preferences for specific individuals, nor other influences such as\
  \ kinship or reciprocity, are taken into account to reproduce the empirical findings."
