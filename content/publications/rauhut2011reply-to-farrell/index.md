abstract: Analyzing the data of the wisdom of crowd experiment by Lorenz et al. (1),
  Farrell (2) points out that information exchange improves individual estimates of
  answers to factual questions. He furthermore suggests that information exchange
  increases individual rewards and that this comes with an increase in confidence
  in their estimates. However, it has to be noted that individual rewards were revealed
  only after subjects specified their confidence. [This also shows that the reference
  to Danchin et al. (3) is not fitting, because in the foraging example, subjects
  were constantly aware of the external metric, namely the success of the foraging
  activities of other individuals.] Moreover, although the original experiment was
  designed to study social interaction effects, Farrell applies a psychological perspective.
  In fact, Farrell's commentary (2) focuses on individual-level effects, whereas Lorenz
  et al. (1) concentrated on group-level effects and show how aggregating micro-outcomes
  can lead to unexpected macro-level effects.
