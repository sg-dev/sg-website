abstract: "Systems design â€“ the term immediately evokes associations with the freedoms\
  \ of a divine creator. However, it is precisely this idea that already describes\
  \ the problem: like any other design, systems design must respect certain boundaries,\
  \ but the complexity of the design is far greater. Before we can even formulate\
  \ systems design questions, we must first clarify what we want to mean by a system,\
  \ which approach we choose to system modelling, and how we validate these models.\
  \ This addresses the methodological - technical aspects of systems design. The methodological\
  \ - critical perspective focuses on the limits of systems design. What do we actually\
  \ want to achieve with systems design? It doesn't take long to draw up a wish list.\
  \ But how meaningful or feasible are these wishes? Here, we must critically question\
  \ our expectations."
