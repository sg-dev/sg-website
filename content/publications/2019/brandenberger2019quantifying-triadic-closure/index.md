abstract: Multi-edge networks capture repeated interactions between individuals. In
  social networks, such edges often form closed triangles, or triads. Standard approaches
  to measure this triadic closure, however, fail for multi-edge networks, because
  they do not consider that triads can be formed by edges of different multiplicity.
  We propose a novel measure of triadic closure for multi-edge networks of social
  interactions based on a shared partner statistic. We demonstrate that our operalization
  is able to detect meaningful closure in synthetic and empirical multi-edge networks,
  where common approaches fail. This is a cornerstone in driving inferential network
  analyses from the analysis of binary networks towards the analyses of multi-edge
  and weighted networks, which offer a more realistic representation of social interactions
  and relations.
