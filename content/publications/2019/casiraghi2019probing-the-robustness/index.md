abstract: We consider a multi-layer network with two layers, $_1$, $_2$. Their intra-layer
  topology shows a scale-free degree distribution and a core-periphery structure.
  A nested structure describes the inter-layer topology, i.e., some nodes from $_1$,
  the generalists, have many links to nodes in $_2$, specialists only have a few.
  This structure is verified by analyzing two empirical networks from ecology and
  economics. To probe the robustness of the multi-layer network, we remove nodes from
  $_1$ with their inter-and intra-layer links and measure the impact on the size of
  the largest connected component, $F_2$, in $_2$, which we take as a robustness measure.
  We test different attack scenarios by preferably removing peripheral or core nodes.
  We also vary the intra-layer coupling between generalists and specialists, to study
  their impact on the robustness of the multi-layer network. We find that some combinations
  of attack scenario and intra-layer coupling lead to very low robustness values,
  whereas others demonstrate high robustness of the multi-layer network because of
  the intra-layer links. Our results shed new light on the robustness of bipartite
  networks, which consider only inter-layer, but no intra-layer links.
