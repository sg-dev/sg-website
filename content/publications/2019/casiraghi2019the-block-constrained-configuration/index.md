abstract: 'We provide a novel family of generative block-models for random graphs
  that naturally incorporates degree distributions: the block-constrained configuration
  model. Block-constrained configuration models build on the generalized hypergeometric
  ensemble of random graphs and extend the well-known configuration model by enforcing
  block-constraints on the edge-generating process. The resulting models are practical
  to fit even to large networks. These models provide a new, flexible tool for the
  study of community structure and for network science in general, where modeling
  networks with heterogeneous degree distributions is of central importance.'
