abstract: 'Analyzing available FAO data from 176 countries over 21 years, we observe
  an increase of complexity in the international trade of maize, rice, soy, and wheat.
  A larger number of countries play a role as producers or intermediaries, either
  for trade or food processing. In consequence, we find that the trade networks become
  more prone to failure cascades caused by exogenous shocks. In our model, countries
  compensate for demand deficits by imposing export restrictions. To capture these,
  we construct higher-order trade dependency networks for the different crops and
  years. These networks reveal hidden dependencies between countries and provide an
  estimate of necessary stock reserves to protect countries from cascading export
  restrictions. They differ substantially from first order networks that do not take
  cascading effects into account. We find rice trade most prone to cascading export
  restrictions. A great number of Asian and African countries are most exposed to
  cascades. Noticeably, the main suppliers are similar for most of the crops: USA,
  Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and India. While shocks in the USA mainly affect South
  America and several Asian countries, the south of Africa is primarily dependent
  on American and Asian exporters. The north of Africa depends strongly on Europe,
  in particular via wheat imports.'
