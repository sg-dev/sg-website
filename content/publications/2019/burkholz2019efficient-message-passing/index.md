abstract: 'How big is the risk that a few initial failures of networked nodes amplify
  to large cascades that endanger the functioning of the system? Common answers refer
  to the average final cascade size. Two analytic approaches allow its computation:
  a) (heterogeneous) mean field approximation and b) belief propagation. The former
  applies to (infinitely) large locally tree-like networks, while the latter is exact
  on finite trees. Yet, cascade sizes can have broad and multi-modal distributions
  that are not well represented by their average. Full distribution information is
  essential to identify likely events and to estimate the tail risk, i.e. the probability
  of extreme events. We therefore present an efficient message passing algorithm that
  calculates the cascade size distribution in finite networks. It is exact on finite
  trees and for a large class of cascade processes. An approximate version applies
  to any network structure and performs well on locally tree-like networks, as we
  show with several examples.'
