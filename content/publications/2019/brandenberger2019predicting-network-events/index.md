abstract: Relational event models are becoming increasingly popular in modeling temporal
  dynamics of social networks. Due to their nature of combining survival analysis
  with network model terms, standard methods of assessing model fit are not suitable
  to determine if the models are specified sufficiently to prevent biased estimates.
  This paper tackles this problem by presenting a simple procedure for model-based
  simulations of relational events. Predictions are made based on survival probabilities
  and can be used to simulate new event sequences. Comparing these simulated event
  sequences to the original event sequence allows for in depth model comparisons (including
  parameter as well as model specifications) and testing of whether the model can
  replicate network characteristics sufficiently to allow for unbiased estimates.
