abstract: We study the role of hierarchical structures in a simple model of collective
  consensus formation based on the bounded confidence model with continuous individual
  opinions. For the particular variation of this model considered in this paper, we
  assume that a bias towards an extreme opinion is introduced whenever two individuals
  interact and form a common decision. As a simple proxy for hierarchical social structures,
  we introduce a two-step decision making process in which in the second step groups
  of like-minded individuals are replaced by representatives once they have reached
  local consensus, and the representatives in turn form a collective decision in a
  downstream process. We find that the introduction of such a hierarchical decision
  making structure can improve consensus formation, in the sense that the eventual
  collective opinion is closer to the true average of individual opinions than without
  it. In particular, we numerically study how the size of groups of like-minded individuals
  being represented by delegate individuals affects the impact of the bias on the
  final population-wide consensus. These results are of interest for the design of
  organisational policies and the optimisation of hierarchical structures in the context
  of group decision making.
