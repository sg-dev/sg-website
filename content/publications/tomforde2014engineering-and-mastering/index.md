abstract: Networked systems are becoming increasingly complex in development and operation.
  Due to this complexity, it is mostly impossible to follow a simple sequential design
  - deploy - use cycle. Instead, development and operation will become more evolutionary
  in nature. Additionally, one can observe that individual complex systems are coupled
  with each other, even though this has never been intended in the early development
  of these systems. As a result, we are facing interwoven systems – multiple open
  time - variant systems are coupled and interact having, e.g., different goals and
  objectives as well as changing system and communication structure. Based on and
  extending the idea of composing Systems of Systems, this article identiﬁes challenges
  that are becoming increasingly apparent as the inevitable integration of systems
  progresses.
