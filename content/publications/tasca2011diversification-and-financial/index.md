abstract: The recent credit crisis of 2007/08 has raised a debate about the so-called
  knife-edge properties of financial markets. The paper contributes to the debate
  shedding light on the controversial relation between risk-diversification and financial
  stability. We model a financial network where assets held by borrowers to meet their
  obligations, include claims against other borrowers and securities exogenous to
  the network. The balance-sheet approach is conjugated with a stochastic setting
  and by a mean-field approximation the law of motion of the system's fragility is
  derived. We show that diversification has an ambiguous effect and beyond a certain
  levels elicits financial instability. Moreover, we find that risk-sharing restrictions
  create a socially preferable outcome. Our findings have significant implications
  for future policy recommendation.
