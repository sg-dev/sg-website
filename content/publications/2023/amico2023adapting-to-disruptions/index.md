abstract: ' Supply chain disruptions cause shortages of raw material and products.
  To increase resilience, i.e., the ability to cope with shocks, substituting goods
  in established supply chains can become an effective alternative to creating new
  distribution links. We demonstrate its impact on supply deficits through a detailed
  analysis of the US opioid distribution system. Reconstructing 40 billion empirical
  distribution paths, our data-driven model allows a unique inspection of policies
  that increase the substitution flexibility. Our approach enables policymakers to
  quantify the trade-off between increasing flexibility, i.e., reduced supply deficits,
  and increasing complexity of the supply chain, which could make it more expensive
  to operate.'
