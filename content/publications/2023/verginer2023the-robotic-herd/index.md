abstract: " We explore human herding in a strategic setting where humans interact\
  \ with automated entities (bots) and study the shift in the behavior and beliefs\
  \ of humans when they are aware of interacting with bots. The strategic setting\
  \ is an online minority game, where 1,997 participants are rewarded for following\
  \ the minority strategy. This setting permits distinguishing between irrational\
  \ herding and rational self-interestâ€”a fundamental challenge in understanding herding\
  \ in strategic contexts. Moreover, participants were divided into two groups: one\
  \ informed of playing against bots (informed condition) and the other unaware (uninformed\
  \ condition). Our findings revealed that while informed participants adjusted their\
  \ beliefs about bots' behavior, their actual decisions remained largely unaffected.\
  \ In both conditions, 30% of participants followed the majority, contrary to theoretical\
  \ expectations of no herding. This study underscores the persistence of herding\
  \ behavior in human decision-making, even when participants are aware of interacting\
  \ with automated entities. The insights provide profound implications for understanding\
  \ human behavior on digital platforms where interactions with bots are common. "
