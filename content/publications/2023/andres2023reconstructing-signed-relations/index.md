abstract: Positive and negative relations play an essential role in human behavior
  and shape the communities we live in. Despite their importance, data about signed
  relations is rare and commonly gathered through surveys. Interaction data is more
  abundant, for instance, in the form of proximity or communication data. So far,
  though, it could not be utilized to detect signed relations. In this paper, we show
  how the underlying signed relations can be extracted with such data. Employing a
  statistical network approach, we construct networks of signed relations in four
  communities. We then show that these relations correspond to the ones reported in
  surveys. Additionally, the inferred relations allow us to study the homophily of
  individuals with respect to gender, religious beliefs, and financial backgrounds.
  We evaluate the importance of triads in the signed network to study group cohesion.
