abstract: 'The proliferation of radical online communities and their violent offshoots
  has sparked great societal concern. However, the current practice of banning such
  communities from mainstream platforms has unintended consequences: (i)&nbsp;the
  further radicalization of their members in fringe platforms where they migrate;
  and (ii)&nbsp;the spillover of harmful content from fringe back onto mainstream
  platforms. Here, in a large observational study on two banned subreddits, r/The_Donald
  and r/fatpeoplehate, we examine how factors associated with the RECRO radicalization
  framework relate to users’ migration decisions. Specifically, we quantify how these
  factors affect users’ decisions to post on fringe platforms and, for those who do,
  whether they continue posting on the mainstream platform. Our results show that
  individual-level factors, those relating to the behavior of users, are associated
  with the decision to post on the fringe platform. Whereas social-level factors,
  users’ connection with the radical community, only affect the propensity to be coactive
  on both platforms. Overall, our findings pave the way for evidence-based moderation
  policies, as the decisions to migrate and remain coactive amplify unintended consequences
  of community bans.'
