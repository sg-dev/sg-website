abstract: We analyse the relation between the emotions and the activity of contributors
  in the Open Source Software project Gentoo. Our case study builds on extensive data
  sets from the project's bug tracking platform Bugzilla, to quantify the activity
  of contributors, and its mail archives, to quantify the emotions of contributors
  by means of sentiment analysis. The Gentoo project is known for a considerable drop
  in development performance after the sudden retirement of a central contributor.
  We analyse how this event correlates with the negative emotions, both in bilateral
  email discussions with the central contributor, and at the level of the whole community
  of contributors. We then extend our study to consider the activity patters on Gentoo
  contributors in general. We find that contributors are more likely to become inactive
  when they express strong positive or negative emotions in the bug tracker, or when
  they deviate from the expected value of emotions in the mailing list. We use these
  insights to develop a Bayesian classifier that detects the risk of contributors
  leaving the project. Our analysis opens new perspectives for measuring online contributor
  motivation by means of sentiment analysis and for real-time predictions of contributor
  turnover in Open Source Software projects.
