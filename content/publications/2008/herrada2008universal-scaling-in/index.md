abstract: Understanding the patterns and processes of diversification of life in the
  planet is a key challenge of science. The Tree of Life represents such diversification
  processes through the evolutionary relationships among the different taxa, and can
  be extended down to intra-specific relationships. Here we examine the topological
  properties of a large set of interspecific and intraspecific phylogenies and show
  that the branching patterns follow allometric rules conserved across the different
  levels in the Tree of Life, all significantly departing from those expected from
  the standard null models. The finding of non-random universal patterns of phylogenetic
  differentiation suggests that similar evolutionary forces drive diversification
  across the broad range of scales, from macro-evolutionary to micro-evolutionary
  processes, shaping the diversity of life on the planet.
