abstract: We study the influence of repulsive interactions on an ensemble of coupled
  excitable rotators. We find that a moderate fraction of repulsive interactions can
  trigger global firing of the ensemble. The regime of global firing, however, is
  suppressed in sufficiently large systems if the network of repulsive interactions
  is fully random, due to self-averaging in its degree distribution. We thus introduce
  a model of partially random networks with a broad degree distribution, where self-averaging
  due to size growth is absent. In this case, the regime of global firing persists
  for large sizes. Our results extend previous work on the constructive effects of
  diversity in the collective dynamics of complex systems.
