abstract: The opinion dynamics model introduced by Deffuant and Weisbuch as well as
  the one by Hegselmann and Krause are rather similar. In both models individuals
  are assumed to have opinions about an issue, they meet and discuss, and they may
  adapt their opinions towards the other agents` opinions or may ignore each other
  if their positions are too different. Both models differ with respect to the number
  of peers they meet at once. Furthermore the model by Deffuant and Weisbuch has a
  convergence parameter that controls how fast agents adapt their opinions. By defining
  the reversed parameter as self-support we can extend the applicability of this parameter
  to scenarios with more than one interaction partner. We investigate the effects
  of changing the number of peers met at once, which is done for different population
  sizes, and the effects of changing the self-support. For describing the dynamics
  we look at different statistics, i.e. number of cluster, number of major clusters,
  and Gini coefficient.
