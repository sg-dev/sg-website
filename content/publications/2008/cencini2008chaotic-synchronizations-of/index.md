abstract: Two replicas of spatially extended chaotic systems synchronize to a common
  spatio-temporal chaotic state when coupled above a critical strength. As a prototype
  of each single spatio-temporal chaotic system a lattice of maps interacting via
  power-law coupling is considered. Furthermore, each unit in the one-dimensional
  chain is linked to the corresponding one in the replica via a local coupling. The
  synchronization transition is studied as a nonequilibrium phase transition, and
  its critical properties are analyzed at varying the spatial interaction range as
  well as the nonlinearity of the dynamical units composing each system. In particular,
  continuous and discontinuous local maps are considered. In both cases the transitions
  are of the second order with critical indices varying with the exponent characterizing
  the interaction range. For discontinuous maps it is numerically shown that the transition
  belongs to the anomalous directed percolation (ADP) family of universality classes,
  previously identified for Levy-flight spreading of epidemic processes. For continuous
  maps, the critical exponents are different from those characterizing ADP, but apart
  from the nearest-neighbor case, the identification of the corresponding universality
  classes remains an open problem. Finally, to test the influence of deterministic
  correlations for the studied synchronization transitions, the chaotic dynamical
  evolutions are substituted by suitable stochastic models. In this framework and
  for the discontinuous case, it is possible to derive an effective Langevin description
  that corresponds to that proposed for ADP.
