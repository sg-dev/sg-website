abstract: In this paper, we present a model of a trust-based recommendation system
  on a social network. The idea of the model is that agents use their social network
  to reach information and their trust relationships to filter it. We investigate
  how the dynamics of trust among agents affect the performance of the system by comparing
  it to a frequency-based recommendation system. Furthermore, we identify the impact
  of network density, preference heterogeneity among agents, and knowledge sparseness
  to be crucial factors for the performance of the system. The system self-organises
  in a state with performance near to the optimum; the performance on the global level
  is an emergent property of the system, achieved without explicit coordination from
  the local interactions of agents.
