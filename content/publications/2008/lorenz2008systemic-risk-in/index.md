abstract: We study the mean field approximation of a recent model of cascades on networks
  relevant to the investigation of systemic risk control in financial networks. In
  the model, the hypothesis of a trend reinforcement in the stochastic process describing
  the fragility of the nodes, induces a trade-off in the systemic risk with respect
  to the density of the network. Increasing the average link density, the network
  is first less exposed to systemic risk, while above an intermediate value the systemic
  risk increases. This result offers a simple explanation for the emergence of instabilities
  in financial systems that get increasingly interwoven. In this paper, we study the
  dynamics of the probability density function of the average fragility. This converges
  to a unique stable distribution which can be computed numerically and can be used
  to estimate the systemic risk as a function of the parameters of the model.
