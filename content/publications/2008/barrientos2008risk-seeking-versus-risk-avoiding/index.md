abstract: We study the performance of various agent strategies in an artificial investment
  scenario. Agents are equipped with a budget, x(t), and at each time step invest
  a particular fraction, q(t), of their budget. The return on investment (RoI), r(t),
  is characterized by a periodic function with different types and levels of noise.
  Risk - avoiding agents choose their fraction q(t) proportional to the expected positive
  RoI, while risk - seeking agents always choose a maximum value qmax if they predict
  the RoI to be positive (“everything on red”). In addition to these different strategies,
  agents have different capabilities to predict the future r(t), dependent on their
  internal complexity. Here, we compare “zero - intelligent” agents using technical
  analysis (such as moving least squares) with agents using reinforcement learning
  or genetic algorithms to predict r(t). The performance of agents is measured by
  their average budget growth after a certain number of time steps. We present results
  of extensive computer simulations, which show that, for our given artificial environment,
  (i) the risk - seeking strategy outperforms the risk - avoiding one, and (ii) the
  genetic algorithm was able to find this optimal strategy itself, and thus outperforms
  other prediction approaches considered.
