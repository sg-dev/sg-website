abstract: In this paper, we present experimental investigations on a day - to - day
  route choice scenario. Here, the equilibrium outcome is, according to real traffic
  observations, fair (equal for all users) but induces an inefficient usage of network
  capacity. Optimal usage would be characterized by some users winning and some losing
  in comparison to the equilibrium state. Coherent alternating cooperation strategies
  can be a suitable solution but they require innovation and group coordination in
  addition to cooperativeness. In these points, our work differs considerably from
  other contributions observing the emergence of cooperation in social dilemmas. By
  classifying the two - person variant of our experiments among the symmetrical 2x2
  games we show the situation of the Route Choice Game not to not addressed by the
  literature so far. Although the equilibrium outcome in this setup is “strongly stable”,
  in our experiments we find eminent empirical evidence of alternating cooperation
  and, thereby, observed persistent utilization of the system optimum that is not
  profitable for all individuals. The transition to this optimal configuration can
  be well described by quantitative considerations that are presented in the paper.
  Furthermore, the straight success of a learning scenario indicates that the collective
  innovation of alternating strategies may be the most critical challenge to the individuals
  instead of just learning to be cooperative. Presumably, this also holds for other
  social dilemma situations.
