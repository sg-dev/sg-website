This SG Symposium will take place at ETH Zürich in Room LEE E 101 on November 24, 2022 from 09:00 to 12:00.

We bring together researchers working on complex networks and data science. We would like to create a platform for exchanging ideas, results, and new methodologies, and to develop new concepts for data-driven research.
A coffee break will precede the last talk.
