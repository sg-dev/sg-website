## Synopsis


In October 2004, Frank Schweitzer established the Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zürich. This symposium celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Chair and also marks the final one under his leadership. Each of the three sessions exemplifies, pars pro toto, the success of the Chair’s interdisciplinary approach.

Invited speakers and former collaborators will provide an overview of their motivations, achievements, and ongoing research questions. They will demonstrate that the diverse topics explored at the Chair over the past 20 years share a common methodological foundation in network science, agent-based modeling, system dynamics, and data science.

Thus, the complexity of social and economic systems can be
effectively addressed by an interdisciplinary team equipped
with the right spirit, skills, and leadership.
