## Synopsis

The *Chair of Systems Design* was founded  at ETH Zürich in
October 2004 -- 
this symposium celebrates the 20th anniversary. 
Three main research lines illustrate, *pars pro toto*,
the interdisciplinary scientific approach typical
for the Chair. 
Invited speakers and former collaborators give an overview
of the motivation, achievements and open questions 
in their research areas. They showcase that the
diversity of topics and methods cultivated at the Chair
over the past 20 years not necessarily lead to fragmented
research. Rather, the complexity of social and economic
systems can be tackled utilizing a common methodological basis in
network science, agent-based modeling, and system dynamics.
