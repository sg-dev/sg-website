Software development still depends on humans. 
The foundation of any successful software project lies in the expertise, skills, and creativity of the individuals involved. As technology continues to evolve, it's essential to recognize the profound impact of human capital â€” ranging from technical proficiency and educational background to the sheer passion that drives innovation.

Beyond individual capabilities, our presentations will explore the equally vital dimension of social capital. It plays a crucial role in fostering collaboration, communication, and collective problem-solving within software development teams.
The ability to build and nurture relationships, effective communication, and a collaborative spirit among team members are integral aspects that contribute to project success. 

Our Symposium addresses the technical and organizational challenges involved in social software engineering.
