## Synopsis

Political polarization and radicalization is more and more seen as a major threat for democratic countries, with alarming consequences. Therefore, research on this topic has vastly increased in different scientific disciplines. But the scientific discourse lacks an integrative perspective on polarization, merging methods and insights from different disciplines. Even more, we miss the exchange between formal modelers, political scientists and sociologists which only would allow to develop such a common perspective. Our workshop shall fill this gap, bringing together an interdisciplinary group of top scientists, to foster awareness, acceptance, and adoption of insights from the respective disciplines.

Contributions revolve around three interlinked topics: <BR>

- **1) Public opinion and opinion dynamics**
	- Polarization: ideology vs. issue stances
	- Opinion dynamics: Mechanisms behind polarization dynamics
	- Measuring Polarization: Moving beyond single dimensions

- **2) Elite polarization**
	- Measuring latent concepts: mapping ideology in a political space
	- Political gridlock: Studying collaboration dynamics in polarized systems
	- In-group vs. out-group: Studying group division strategies

- **3) Mitigation and mechanism design**
	- Opinion formation and change: Mechanism design and mitigation strategies
	- Populism as a dividing mechanism
