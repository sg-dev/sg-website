## Synopsis

According to the theory of structural balance, interacting systems balance the (positive or negative) relations between different system elements such that local conflicts are minimized. Hence, structural imbalances induce a dynamics to resolve such conflicts. This dynamics plays a vital role in evolutionary processes because a multitude of possible solutions exists. At the same time, if these solutions cannot be reached, this can hamper the functionality of systems. 

This general problem also occurs in social systems, where instead of a more balanced state, for instance, the polarization of opinions emerges. Are we able to address this problem from a formal perspective? Do we have data available to study it in real systems? Can we develop models that help us to understand when structural balance fails, and how it can be mitigated?

Our workshop shall provide a platform to discuss these questions from a multi-disciplinary perspective, involving researchers from the complexity and the social sciences. 
Contributions revolve around three interlinked topics: <BR>

- Signed Relations and Structural Balance in Complex Systems
- Evolution of Signed Relation and Emergence of Structural Balance
- Mitigating the Implications of Structural Imbalance

The workshop celebrates the completion of the binational
collaborative research project on signed relations and
structural balance jointly funded by the Polish National
Science Foundation (Grant No: xxx) and the Swiss National
Science Foundation (SNSF Grant No: 105213L_192746). 

We gratefully acknowledge 
additional financial support for the workshop from the
*Swiss National Science Foundation* (SNSF Grant No: IZSEZ0_XXXX) and from the *Chair of Systems Design (ETH Zurich)*.
