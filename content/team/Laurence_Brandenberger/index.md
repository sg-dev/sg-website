I study legislative politics and political networks. I am particularly interested in the temporal dynamics of political actors working together, for instance looking at how long it takes for a member of parliament to reciprocate a favor by a colleague. Furthermore, I study how political actors change their political positions over time and influence each other.

I am a quantitative social scientist who loves using computational tools (such as NER, ML or word embeddings) to enhance my insights into substantive research questions.

Prior to starting at the Chair of Systems Design, a received a PhD in Political Science from the University of Bern and a Master's degree in Sociology from the University of Bern.
