I study legislative behavior and parliamentary networks. I am particularly interested in the temporal dynamics of political actors working together, for instance looking at how long it takes for a member of parliament to reciprocate a favor by a colleague. Furthermore, I study how political actors change their political positions over time and influence each other.

As a quantitative social scientist, I use Relational Event Models (REMs), Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) and temporal variations thereof (so-called TERGMs or BTERGMs) and conventional regressions for my analyses.

Prior to starting at the Chair of Systems Design, a received a PhD in Political Science from the University of Bern and a Master's degree in Sociology from the University of Bern.
