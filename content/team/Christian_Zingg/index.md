In my research, I study the effects that shocks have on the network structure of social systems. To examine structural changes, I define and analyze measures that are, for example, based on entropies. Having a theoretical background yet being interested in real-world problems, it is essential to me to discuss both theory and applications.

Before starting as a PhD at the Chair of Systems Design, I studied applied mathematics at the ETH Zurich. My focus was on statistics as well as systems design.
