In my research I study the effects that shocks have on the network structure of social systems. To examine structural changes I define and analyze measures that are for example based on entropies. Having a theoretical background yet being interested in real world problems it is very important to me to discuss both theory and applications.

Before starting at the Chair of Systems Design as a PhD I studied applied mathematics at the ETH Zurich. My focus there was on statistics as well as systems design.
