<h3>Thermodynamics of Finite Systems and the<br>
Kinetics of First-Order Phase Transitions</h3>

Phase transitions between different states of matter occur in many
equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. The kinetics of these phase
changes are studied mainly in the case of condensation of a 
vapour in a supersaturated state via homogeneous nucleation. Based on
thermodynamic investigations of heterogeneous systems, the stochastic
and deterministic theory of nucleation and growth of the new phase is
derived.  Emphasis is put on finite-size-effects which lead to a
depletion of the vapour. The results are mainly explained in terms of
clusters (droplet model) and extended to the influence of external
fields. Numerous computer simulations are presented.
