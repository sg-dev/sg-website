A simple model for interactive structure formation is studied to simulate
the trail formation by ants based on local chemical communication. In our
model, active random walkers, which do not have the ability of visual
navigation or storage of information, first have to discover different
distributions of food sources and then have to link these sources to a
central place by forming a trail, using no other guidance than the
chemical markings produced by themselves. The simulations show the
spontaneous emergence of a collective trail system due to
self-organization, which is both stable and flexible to include newly
discovered sources. The typical dendritic foraging patterns of desert
ants, reported by H&ouml;lldobler and M&ouml;glich (1980), are reproduced by
the simulations.
