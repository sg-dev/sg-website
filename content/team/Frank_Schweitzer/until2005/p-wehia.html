<dd>
  Brownian agents denote a particular class of heterogeneous agents that
  combines features of reactive and reflexive agent concepts.  As one
  major advance, the Brownian agent concept allows the derivation of
  macroscopic equations from the agent dynamics, which can be used to
  analyze and predict the behavior of the MAS.  As an application of the
  concept, we discuss a binary choice problem where individual
  decisions are based on different local information generated by the
  agents. The spatial coordination of decisions in a multi-agent
  community is investigated both analytically and by means of stochastic
  computer simulations.  We find that dependent on two essential
  parameters describing the local impact and the spatial dissemination of
  information either a definite stable minority/majority relation
  (single-attractor regime) or a broad range of possible values
  (multi-attractor regime) occurs. In the latter case, the outcome of the
  decision process becomes rather diverse and hard to predict, both with
  respect to the fraction of the majority and their spatial distribution.
  We also show that a more ``efficient'' information dissemination of
  a subpopulation provides a suitable way to stabilize their majority
  status and to reduce ``diversity'' and
  uncertainty in the decision process. <br>
