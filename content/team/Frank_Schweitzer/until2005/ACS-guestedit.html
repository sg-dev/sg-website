<P>
In a world of fast growing population, intercontinental trade relations,
and an ever increasing demand for technological innovations and economic
growth in a developing society, the unterstanding of dynamic processes in
economics is one of the major challenges of the twentyfirst century.

<P>
In the life and social sciences, one is usually convinced that the
evolution of social systems is determined by numerous factors, difficult
to grasp, such as cultural, sociological, economic, political, ecological
ingredients.  However, in recent years, the development of the
interdisciplinary field ``science of complexity'' has led to the insight,
that complex dynamic processes may also result from simple interactions.
Moreover, at a certain level of abstraction, one can also find many
common features between complex structures in very different fields.

<P>
The recent progress in the understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena in
complex systems has also initiated a lot of activities in analyzing,
modelling and simulating ``living'' systems with methods from statistical
physics.  Already in the early seventies, physicists have realized that
these methods can help to understand social phenomena, such as opinion
formation, migration, and settlement formation. But only very recently,
physicists have focussed their interdisciplinary interests to particular
economic processes, such as trading, market dynamics, or company growth.

<P>
The joint efforts of many research groups spread over the world
eventually lead to the establishment of <I>econophysics</I> - a young
and fast growing field, the potential importance of which can be hardly
overestimated. Even with the analysis of financial time series as its
current focus, econophysics is meant to be a more comprehensive
enterprise. Basically, econophysics focusses on the question how and to
what extent methods from statistical physics can be used for the
analysis, modeling, simulation, and optimization of economic systems.

<P>
In order to make this enterprise a successful one, a broad and openminded
dialog is needed between physics, economics and the social sciences.
This dialog should help to overcome the gap between these different
disciplines (i) by providing methods from the natural sciences, which
could be adapted to solving problems in social or economic fields, and
(ii) by increasing among natural scientists the sensitivity for problems
in the fields of economics and the social sciences.

<P>
The present special issue of <I>Advances in Complex Systems</I> shall
contribute to this dialog by providing contributions of both physicists
and economists in the challenging field of econophysics. These papers
have been presented at an international workshop on <EM> Economic
  Dynamics from the Physics Point of View</EM>, which was organized as the
229th WE-Heraeus Seminar and took place in the Physics Center Bad Honnef
between 27th and 30th of April, 2000 (see <TT><a href="WEH-workshop.html"> WEH-workshop.html</a></TT>
for details).

<P>
Basically, the workshop concentrated on two main problems: (i) the
analysis of economic time series and other data with the aim of
determining scaling laws and correlations, (ii) the investigation of
microscopic models which mimic economic systems based on non-linear
interactions of a large number of elements. Further topics were the
statistical modeling of decision processes, the emergence of collective
dynamics and chaos in socio-economic systems, as well as possibilities to
control them.

<P>
The particular emphasis of the workshop on dynamic micro-models intends
to provide insight into economic interactions, which may eventually
explain the complex dynamics found in the data.  Similar to physics,
where the structure, properties and dynamics of matter can be deduced
from microscopic interaction laws, one would finally like to explain the
observed macroscopic dynamics of organizations or companies, markets, and
prizes based on non-linear interactions among a huge number of different
individuals (agents).

<P>
The various contributions of the workshop are published in the present
issue of <EM> Advances in Complex Systems</EM> and a special issue of<a
href="contents-physa.html"> <EM> 
  Physica A</EM>, <B>287</B>/3-4 (2000)</a>. Both special issues have their own
focus: Contributions with a close relation to statistical physics,
especially those dealing with time series analysis of economic data, have
been selected for <EM> Physica A</EM>, while papers focussing on multi-agent
approaches to market behavior, technological evolution and applications
of neural network techniques have been selected for <EM> <a
href="contents-acs.new.html">Advances in Complex Systems</a></EM>.


<P>
It is the hope of the guest editors, that the present special issue will
stimulate fruitful discussions among physicists and experts in the
socio-economic sciences and further the international activities and
cooperation in the field of econophysics.
