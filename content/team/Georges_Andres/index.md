## Interests
My work explores the dynamics of complex systems, focusing on how structural and temporal patterns shape interactions within them. By leveraging advanced models like hypergraphs, temporal networks, and zero-inflated frameworks, I aim to uncover the hidden mechanisms behind sparsity, critical transitions, and polyadic interactions in real-world systems.

Prior to completing my PhD at the Chair of Systems design in 2024, I received a Master's degree in Physics from ETH Zurich.
