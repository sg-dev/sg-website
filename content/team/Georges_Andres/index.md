## Interests
My current research topics are centered around structural balance theory and opinion formation in social systems. During my Master's in physics at the ETHZ I encountered the study of complex systems via network representations and agent based models. The fascination for this line of research lead me to pursue a PhD at the Chair of Systems Design.
