I am an economist researching through the methods of complex systems, temporal network analysis, machine learning and standard econometrics migration of high skill labour, citation dynamics in patents and papers and spatial diffusion of knowledge.

I am also a core contributor of Pathpy, the open source temporal network analysis library developed here at SG and the DAG Group at the University of ZÃ¼rich.
Work on the exciting and novel field of temporal networks allows me to test these methods on various economic networks (e.g. Supply Chains).

Prior to joining Chair of Systems Design Team, I received a Master's degree in Economics from the University of Trento and a PhD in Economics and Data Science from IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca.
