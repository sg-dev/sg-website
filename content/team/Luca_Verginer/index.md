I am a Postdoc at che Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zürich and hold a Ph.D. in Economics and Data Science from IMT Lucca.

I am an empirical economist and network scientist studying through econometrics, numerical simulations, and network models issues related to intellectual property, supply chain resilience and high skill labour mobility, among (many) other subjects. I am passionate about data in all its forms (and sizes) and constantly looking for curious and ingenious ways to visualize, collect and extract value from it.

My work is driven by research questions that make use of state-of-the-art modelling techniques often involving large datasets, natural language processing, complex networks with a special focus on temporal networks.

Prior to joining Chair of Systems Design Team, I  received a
**Master's degree in Economics** from the University of Trento and a **PhD in Economics and Data Science** from IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca.
I am also a core contributor to [Pathpy], an open source **temporal network analysis** library developed in collaboration with the [DAG group University of Zürich][dag] and the University of Wuppertal.
