My main interests are in the quantification of knowledge and of its exchange in academia and in R&D activities.

In particular, I concentrate on two specific classes of problems. The first class of problems is related to the question of how knowledge artifacts are linked to each other, ranked and filtered in repositories. Examples of repositories are patent and scientific publication databases. The second class of problems relates to the question of how knowledge is exchanged and transferred. Indeed, knowledge is not only produced and encoded in knowledge artifacts, as patents or scientific publications, but it is also exchanged by humans and it diffuses in our society. R&D alliances among firms and co-authorship of papers among scientists are examples of activities favoring knowledge exchange. While the physical migration of inventors or scientists is an example of knowledge transfer/migration.

To answer the above questions, I develop statistical methods and agent-based models.
