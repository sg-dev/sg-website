Giacomo is a senior researcher at the Chair of Systems Design, ETH Zurich.
In this group, he worked as a post-doc and obtained a Doctorate in Science in 2019.
Before joining ETH Zurich, he completed the Part III of the Mathematical Tripos from the University of Cambridge and received a Master in Theoretical Physics from Sapienza University of Rome.

Giacomo's research interests lie in understanding the determinants and effects of cooperation in socio-economic systems.
He studies [how collaborations are established](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0117-5) among firms or scientists to create new knowledge.
He also investigates how the knowledge of these actors, in turn, [defines their collaborations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-018-0569-1).
To capture this feedback, he combines statistical analysis of patent and publication data with agent-based models.
In recent years, he has worked extensively on how psychological and cognitive processes can foster but also hamper the [emergence of cooperation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219525920500186).
To this end, he has developed mathematical models and experiments leveraging game theory and complex systems theory.

Giacomo publishes papers in major peer-review journals.
He is a member of the editorial board for the journal Social Network Analysis and Mining and has been a guest editor of the journal Advances of Complex Systems.
He is also an active reviewer for various venues, including Journal of Informetrics, European Physics Journal - Data Science, and Physica A.

On top of the research activity, Giacomo has been teaching the course [Agent-Based Modelling of Social Systems](https://www.sg.ethz.ch/teaching/abm/) with [Prof. Frank Schweitzer](https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/frank_schweitzer/).
