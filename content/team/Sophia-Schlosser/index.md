Prior to joining the chair of Systems Design for her doctorate, Sophia received a Bachelor's degree in Communications and Political Science from the University of ZÃ¼rich, and a Master's degree in International Affairs from the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin and the Graduate Institute in Geneva.
Sophia's research interests focus on political networks, in particular covering political polarization dynamics, the professionalization processes of parliaments, and the science-policy nexus. 
Her doctoral dissertation focussed on how to best apply current NLP methods to study legislative dynamics of the Swiss Federal Asembly from 1891 to today.
