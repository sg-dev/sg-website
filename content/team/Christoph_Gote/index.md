Christoph Gote is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zurich and at the Data Analytics Group at the University of Zurich. His research focuses on the analysis of collaboration structures in software development teams. To this end, he develops tools, such as git2net and gambit, that facilitate the extraction and cleaning of action and interaction data from git repositories. From these actions and interactions, he subsequently derives fine-grained social and technical networks. Based on these networks, he studies topics such as the optimal size for teams, the relationship between coordination structures and team productivity, the emergence of hierarchies, and team resilience. For this research, he applies a broad range of methods from data-driven modelling, statistics, machine learning, and network analysis. In addition, he develops state-of-the-art techniques for temporal-, higher-, and multi-order network analysis.
