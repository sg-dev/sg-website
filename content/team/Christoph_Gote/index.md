Postdoctoral Researcher at the Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. My current research focuses on the analysis of collaboration structures in software development teams. To this end, I apply data-driven modelling and network analysis to large sets repositories of Open Source Software (OSS) projects. I further develops tools to facilitate the extraction of information from OSS repositories, as well as methods for temporal- and higher-order network analysis.
