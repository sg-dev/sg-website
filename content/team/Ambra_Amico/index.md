Before joining the Chair, I received a Master degree in physics at la Sapienza University in Rome, where I got interested in the complex systems field. During my master thesis I applied inference methods and machine learning techniques to study human perception of facial beauty.
Currently, my research interests focus on cascade processes, namely I am studying how a local shock, appeared in a system, affects its different parts. By adopting a network perspective I can measure the cascade size and  identify the possible characteristics of the system that prevent a big cascade size. Additionally, I am interested in temporal network analysis and in its possible application to the cascade phenomenon.
