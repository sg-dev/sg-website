I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zurich, where I completed my PhD in 2023 under the guidance of Prof. Frank Schweitzer. 
With a background in physics, I got fascinated by the field of complex systems and its interface with economics and social sciences.
My current research is centred around large-scale supply chains, specifically focusing on the dynamics of distribution systems. 
I am interested in devising novel strategies to enhance their resilience against disruptions.
Recognizing the profound impact of their complex topology on resilience, I am also intrigued by the mechanisms governing these systems' formation and how they give rise to the observed structures. 
My approach combines large-scale empirical analysis with formal modeling techniques borrowed from complexity science.
