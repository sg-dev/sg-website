  abstract	= {From the Foreword by J. Doyne Farmer: "This book lays out a vision for a coherent framework for
		  understanding complex systems. However, it should be viewed
		  as a beginning rather than an end. There is still a great
		  deal to be done in making more detailed connections to real
		  problems and in making quantitative, falsifiable
		  predictions. Despite the wide range of problems discussed
		  here, I suspect that this is only a small subset of the
		  possibilities where the Brownian agent method can be
		  applied. While I donâ€™t think that Brownian agents will
		  gain a monopoly on theoretical modeling in complex systems,
		  this book does a major service by introducing this new tool
		  and demonstrating its generality and power in a wide range
		  of diverse applications. This work will likely have an
		  important influence on complex systems modeling in the
		  future. And perhaps most importantly, it adds to the unity
		  of knowledge by showing how phenomena in widely different
		  areas can be addressed within a common mathematical
		  framework and, for some purposes, most of the details can
		  be ignored."},
