To make these challenges visible and address their causes, we have to make use of advanced statistics in order to disentangle complex interdependencies between the driving factors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this course, we use methods of statistical inference to measure, analyze and interpret social behavior. The course aims at building up methodological skills and places a strong focus on interpretation and reflection of results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social Data Science</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/teaching/social-data-science/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 13:58:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/teaching/social-data-science/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="description">Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Social Data Science is an emerging field that studies human behavior and social interaction through digital traces. The revolution in measurement brought by our digital society gives us data at global scales, very high frequencies, and unprecedented levels of depth and resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course focuses both on the fundamentals and applications of Data Science in the Social Sciences, including technologies for data retrieval, processing, and analysis with the aim to derive insights that are interpretable from a wider theoretical perspective. The lectures introduce theoretical foundations and present practical examples and technologies, using the R statistical language from a literate programming perspective. Weekly exercise classes provide practical skills and discuss the solutions to exercises that build on the concepts and methods presented in the previous lectures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Systems Dynamics and Complexity</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/teaching/system-dynamics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 21:43:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/teaching/system-dynamics/</guid><description>&lt;p>The course encompasses a large range of approaches towards systems and their dynamics, with particular emphasis on problem solving.
It starts from basic insights on why real problems are not simple but complex, and why systems do not always do what we expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on that, we introduce tools and methods commonly used in &lt;strong>Systems Engineering&lt;/strong> (systems oriented management) and &lt;strong>Project Management&lt;/strong> to analyse problems at large, to search for solutions and to optimize project scheduling.
The part of &lt;strong>Systems Dynamics&lt;/strong> focuses on models of systems with various positive and negative feedback loops, which exhibit, for example, unwanted oscillations. Using examples of &lt;strong>Economic Dynamics&lt;/strong>, such as the adoption of new products or the competition between technologies, we also develop an understanding of the specific nonlinear dynamics in markets. Eventually, we investigate the effects of &lt;strong>Nonlinear Dynamics&lt;/strong> on the instability of systems and their long-term predictiveness, with applications in supply chains and manufacturing systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Agent-based Modelling of Social Systems</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/teaching/abm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 21:43:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/teaching/abm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Individuals live in groups!
Their weave of dynamical and differentiated interactions results in complex societies, whose properties and ruling principles can only be fully unraveled when studying the underlying social system from a formal standpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this course, we use &lt;strong>agent-based modelling&lt;/strong> as a bottom-up tool to study social systems.
Agents have internal degrees of freedom (opinions, strategies), the ability to perceive and to change their environment, and to interact with other agents.
Their (inter)actions result in collective dynamics with emergent properties that need to be analyzed and understood quantitatively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Complex Networks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/teaching/complex-networks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 21:36:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/teaching/complex-networks/</guid><description>&lt;p>The course provides an overview of the methods and abstractions used in:&lt;/p>
