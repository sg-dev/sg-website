Since our DemocraSci database spans over 130 years, we examine how voting is reported from 1891 until today.</p><h1 id=voting-records-over-time>Voting records over time</h1><p>Voting records for the National Council and the Council of States are reported differently throughout the years (see Figure below).</p><p><img src=tikz_votingTimeline.png alt="How voting records are reported from 1891 until today"></p><p>For the National Council, electronic voting was accepted in 1987 and enacted in 1994, ebbing the way for more detailed voting records.
Before the winter session of 1995, voting records are mainly reported as aggregated counts, i.e., reporting how many members are for or against a specific proposal or proposition.
Only if 30 MPs demanded roll-call voting, did the records reflect the names of the MPs voting for/against a proposal/proposition.
With the implementation of electronic voting, voting records became more accessible. However, at first, only final votes (Gesamt/Schlussabstimmung) were reported as roll-call votes, for the rest, aggregated vote counts were reported.
From the winter session 2007 onwards, all votes are reported as roll-call votes in the National Council.</p><p>For the Council of States it took longer to implement electronic voting (2013 accepted, spring session 2014 enacted) and slightly longer for all votes to be reported as roll-call votes (spring session 2022).</p><hr><h2 id=voting-records-for-federal-enactment-drafts-parliamentary-initiatives-phase-2-and-cantonal-initiatives-phase-2>Voting records for federal enactment drafts, parliamentary initiatives (phase 2) and cantonal initiatives (phase 2)</h2><h3 id=pre-1995-nr--pre-2014-sr>pre 1995 (NR) // pre 2014 (SR)</h3><h4 id=entry-vote>Entry vote</h4><p>Enactment drafts generally start the debate with an introductory debate (Eintretensdebatte) after which entering the debate is voted on.
Sometimes, entry is voted on silently.</p><blockquote><p><img src=1903_20027243_page5.png alt="Example of a silent vote on entering the detailed debate (1903, Document ID 20027243)">
<span style=color:gray><em>Example of a silent vote on entering the detailed debate (1903, Document ID 20027243)</em></span>.</p></blockquote><h4 id=votes-on-detailed-propositions>Votes on detailed propositions</h4><p>In the detailed discussions of enactment drafts (originating from the federal council, parliamentary initiatives or cantonal initiatives), different propositions are debated and voted on. If a proposition is not contested (no objects), it is accepted without a vote, i.e., the president reports &ldquo;Angenommen&rdquo; in the Amtliches Bulletin.</p><p>Sometimes (especially prior to 1920), the votes are documented at the end of the debate. Sometimes the votes are located within the debate. When and how the votes on propositions takes place depends, in part, also on the president and how they guide the debate.</p><blockquote><p><img src=1903_20027247_page5.png alt="Example of voting records in the AB on an enactment draft (including Eintretensabstimmung, detailed propositions and final vote) in 1903 (Document 20027247)">
