Yet how should they be measured? And is the required data available? Also, Modern research is predominantly a team endeavor in which success and failure strongly depends on social forces among collaborators driven by intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, behavior and strategy. Do we have the right models to account for these phenomena?
If these questions drive your research, you are interested in our Special Issue on Scientific Networks and Success.</description></item><item><title>G Hypernet on R</title><link>https://sg-dev.github.io/sg-website/2020/05/g-hypernet-on-r/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sg-dev.github.io/sg-website/2020/05/g-hypernet-on-r/</guid><description>The latest version of our R library ghypernet is available on CRAN.
