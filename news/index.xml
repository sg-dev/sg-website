Course abstract Many of today&amp;rsquo;s societal challenges cannot be adequately grasped simply by observing human behavior. To make these challenges visible and address their causes, we have to make use of advanced statistics in order to disentangle complex interdependencies between the driving factors.
In this course, we use methods of statistical inference to measure, analyze and interpret social behavior.</description></item><item><title>SG Seminar by Prof. Animesh Mukherjee</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/talk-animesh-mukherjee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/talk-animesh-mukherjee/</guid><description>Prof. Animesh Mukherjee from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur will present his work on the rise of hate content in online social media.

Do they help or hamper the emergence of consensus? We study this problem by taking a network perspective and specifically using the adaptive voter model. This is a variation of the voter model where agents can either adopt the opinion of their neighbors or rewire. Here, we extend this model beyond pairwise interactions to include group interactions. For this, we depict the groups as hyperedges.</description></item><item><title>Talk Sanjukta Krishnagopal</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/talk-sanjukta-krishnagopal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 15:25:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/talk-sanjukta-krishnagopal/</guid><description>Sanjukta Krishnagopal from the University College London will present her work on higher order network representations.

We refer to these instruments as parliamentary bills (dt. Geschäfte). While some of the bill types are used only to gather information or get insights from the executive branch (i.e., the federal council or the departments), others are used to propose legislative changes.
In this blogpost we present 9 types of bills and how they move through the parliament. For each bill, we detail 8 different (potential) phases the bill goes through from submission to enactment.</description></item><item><title>New AJPS article on policy networks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/polsci_ajpsarticle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/polsci_ajpsarticle/</guid><description>New publication in the American Journal of Political Science is out.

Research question The link between political systems and the structure of policy networks has received little attention in the policy studies literature. But the way the political system is set up can have deep impacts on how actors embedded in it engage with each other. In this article we examine power structures and interaction patterns between policy actors.</description></item><item><title>Success in Science - Special Issue</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/success-in-science-special-issue/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/success-in-science-special-issue/</guid><description>We are glad that our special issue on the Success in Science is now available online In this issue, we collect and present developments in the field of Science of Science under a complex system perspective.

Agents have a heterogeneous fitness for solving tasks and can redistribute unfinished tasks to other agents. They learn over time to whom to reassign tasks and preferably choose agents with higher fitness. A lock-in occurs if reassignments can no longer adapt. Agents overwhelmed with tasks then fail, leading to failure cascades. We find that the probability for lock-ins and systemic failures increase with the heterogeneity in fitness values.</description></item><item><title>Amtliches Bulletin: records of speeches, propositions and votes -- Part 2</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_7_ab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_7_ab/</guid><description>In this blogpost we go into details on the information contained in the Amtliches Bulletin (AB) and how we separate the different entities and label them.

We examine the external validity of data on political behavior exhibited online and compare it to offline behavior. We overlay two data sets on political support among members of the Swiss parliament to estimate the explanatory power of online endorsements on offline cosponsorship signatures among members, using a gHypEG network regression model. Whereas offline support behavior is driven by a broad range of factors, such as network and homophily effects, online endorsement is less diverse.</description></item><item><title>Systems Design Bottom Up</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/design/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/design/</guid><description>Two short texts for the general audience explain the problems of systems design in complex systems:

As highlighted in Part 1 of our series on Summary Documents, we extract a lot of information from these documents. Most importantly, these documents are our baseline for the complete list of bills presented to parliament. They also include information about cosponsorship signatures, which can be used to study legislative collaborations and alliances.
In this blogpost we talk about the numbering of bills as well as presenting some exceptions that caused us some headaches when exporting and structuring their information.</description></item><item><title>Theory of social roles</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/theory_of_social_roles_in_networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/theory_of_social_roles_in_networks/</guid><description>Our new paper A new theory of social roles in networks is available now.
Individuals fulfill different social roles in different contexts. For example, a professor teaches in a lecture theatre and does research in the lab. Especially in large networks, this context is very heterogenous as local clusters form. If these clusters are not addressed role detection yields flawed results. We address the effect of clusters on roles in networks with a novel theory of social roles.</description></item><item><title>Historical Network research lunch lecture</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/hnr_lunch_lecture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/hnr_lunch_lecture/</guid><description>Ramona Roller presents how to treat time in a letter correspondence network of the Reformation.
The Reformation is characterised by frequent letter correspondences between scholars which can be modeled as a network. Letters have sending dates, providing a temporal order for the spread of ideas and routes of influence. This temporal order of letters affects network measures and therefore has to be considered in network analyses. I show how to address this challenge by using pathpy a software to analyse temporal networks.</description></item><item><title>Summary Documents and the Secrets they Hold -- Part 1</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_4-summarydocs_part1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_4-summarydocs_part1/</guid><description>One of our main data sources for our Project 130 Years of Swiss Parliament (click here for the project overview) are so-called summary of proceedings documents.

For the past 130 years (starting in 1891), the Swiss Parliament has carefully documented its actions and debates in the so-called Amtliches Bulletin&amp;mdash;a stenographic record of parliamentary speeches and legislative proposals. In our project we carefully extract and structure the data from the Amtliches Bulletin.
Our database will contain
all bills, legislative proposals and parliamentary questions brought forth by members of the parliament, comittees, parliamentary groups (called Fraktionen) and cantons (in the form of a Standesinitative) all speeches recorded in the Amtliches Bulletin all members passing through the parliament as well as their functions, their committee memberships and their involvement in parliamentary affairs all votes and voting outcomes for proposals all cosponsorship signatures from members of parliament on bills The project is a collaboration between our chair and the Swiss Data Science Center, SDSC.</description></item><item><title>Scientific Networks and Success</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/acs_call_for_papers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/acs_call_for_papers/</guid><description>Researchers along with their research institutions are increasingly evaluated according to scientific performance metrics.

We use this relation to determine reputation spillovers between transnational companies and their participated companies in an ownership network core of 1318 firms. We then apply concepts of network controllability to identify minimum sets of driver nodes (MDS) of 314 firms in this network.

A new model of opinion formation shows how the extent to which people like or dislike each other affects their political views ?and vice versa. The resulting division of societies can even become a matter of life and death, as the current crises show.

It will take place online on September 17, 2020.
HONS is the NetSci satellite for researchers that try to understand what we miss when we analyze graphs and network abstractions of complex systems. Its focus is on cutting-edge Higher-Order Network modelling techniques, which generalize network science techniques to models that account for higher-order dependencies in data on real systems.</description></item><item><title>Network Analysis in R</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/network-analysis-in-r/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/network-analysis-in-r/</guid><description>The latest version of our R library ghypernet is available on CRAN.

At dusk, these groups dissolve, at dawn they may re-merge. So, what is a typical group size? And how long does a group use the same roost? We answer these questions by analyzing empirical data from two colonies. What is more, we also provide an agent-based model to reproduce these findings.

We study the emergence of large drop-out cascades of users leaving the OSN by means of an agent-based model. Our aim is to prevent such drop-out cascades by influencing specific agents. We identify strategies to control agents such that drop-out cascades are significantly reduced, and the robustness of the OSN is increased.

The paper discusses phenomena as diverse as saturated growth, competition, stochastic growth, investments in random environments, wealth redistribution, opinion dynamics and the wisdom of crowds, reputation dynamics, knowledge growth, and the combination with network dynamics.
