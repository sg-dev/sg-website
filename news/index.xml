The ease of creating user accounts online results in single individuals appearing under multiple aliases. If these ambiguities are not adequately resolved, subsequent studies can be significantly biased. gambit enables researches to disambiguate an individual&amp;rsquo;s different aliases to a unique identifier and therefore represents an essential first step in any study analysing real-world user data.</description></item><item><title>GHYPERNET in the top 40!</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2021/03/ghypernet-in-the-top-40/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 12:02:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2021/03/ghypernet-in-the-top-40/</guid><description>The RStudio blog has listed our ghypernet R package in the top 40 picks of May 2020!

These data can be used to analyze the European reformation of the 16th century.
The workshop &amp;lsquo;Geography meets Digital Humanities: Neuere Ans√§tze raumbezogener Modellierung&amp;rsquo; addresses the question of how to use &amp;lsquo;space&amp;rsquo; in scientific analyses in the Digital Humanities. Definitions of &amp;lsquo;space&amp;rsquo; range from interpretative frameworks to geographic notations. Ramona presents a novel data set comprising geo-spatial attributes of territories of the Holy Roman Empire in the 16th century.</description></item><item><title>Scientific Networks and Success</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2021/01/scientific-networks-and-success/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2021/01/scientific-networks-and-success/</guid><description>Researchers along with their research institutions are increasingly evaluated according to scientific performance metrics. Yet how should they be measured? And is the required data available? Also, Modern research is predominantly a team endeavor in which success and failure strongly depends on social forces among collaborators driven by intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, behavior and strategy. Do we have the right models to account for these phenomena?
If these questions drive your research, you are interested in our Special Issue on Scientific Networks and Success.</description></item><item><title>Should the government reward cooperation?</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2021/01/should-the-government-reward-cooperation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2021/01/should-the-government-reward-cooperation/</guid><description>We derive analytical expressions for the critical bonus needed to make cooperation as attractive as defection. We show that for one information regime the critical bonus increases with the level of cooperation, while in a second regime the bonus decreases with the level of cooperation. In this second regime, full cooperation can be achieved once a cold-start problem is solved.

We use this relation to determine reputation spillovers between transnational companies and their participated companies in an ownership network core of 1318 firms. We then apply concepts of network controllability to identify minimum sets of driver nodes (MDS) of 314 firms in this network.

It will take place online on September 17, 2020.
HONS is the NetSci satellite for researchers that try to understand what we miss when we analyze graphs and network abstractions of complex systems. Its focus is on cutting-edge Higher-Order Network modelling techniques, which generalize network science techniques to models that account for higher-order dependencies in data on real systems.</description></item><item><title>Network Analysis in R</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2020/05/network-analysis-in-r/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2020/05/network-analysis-in-r/</guid><description>The latest version of our R library ghypernet is available on CRAN.

At dusk, these groups dissolve, at dawn they may re-merge. So, what is a typical group size? And how long does a group use the same roost? We answer these questions by analyzing empirical data from two colonies. What is more, we also provide an agent-based model to reproduce these findings. See our paper here.</description></item><item><title>Who are the leaders and followers among bats?</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2019/11/who-are-the-leaders-and-followers-among-bats/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/2019/11/who-are-the-leaders-and-followers-among-bats/</guid><description>Bats don&amp;rsquo;t tell!

We study the emergence of large drop-out cascades of users leaving the OSN by means of an agent-based model. Our aim is to prevent such drop-out cascades by influencing specific agents. We identify strategies to control agents such that drop-out cascades are significantly reduced, and the robustness of the OSN is increased.

The paper discusses phenomena as diverse as saturated growth, competition, stochastic growth, investments in random environments, wealth redistribution, opinion dynamics and the wisdom of crowds, reputation dynamics, knowledge growth, and the combination with network dynamics.
