Yet how should they be measured? And is the required data available? Also, Modern research is predominantly a team endeavor in which success and failure strongly depends on social forces among collaborators driven by intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, behavior and strategy. Do we have the right models to account for these phenomena?
If these questions drive your research, you are interested in our Special Issue on Scientific Networks and Success.</description></item><item><title>G Hypernet on R</title><link>/2020/05/g-hypernet-on-r/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/05/g-hypernet-on-r/</guid><description>The latest version of our R library ghypernet is available on CRAN.
The library allows studying multi-edge networks using the framework of the generalised hypergeometric ensemble of random graphs. install the package by running

We will carry out this project together with Prof. Holyst&amp;rsquo;s group of Physics in Economy and Social Sciences at Warsaw University of Technology (Faculty of Physics).</description></item><item><title>Let's spend the night together?</title><link>/2019/12/lets-spend-the-night-together/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/12/lets-spend-the-night-together/</guid><description>Bechstein&amp;rsquo;s bats form groups of different size to spend the day together in several roosts. At dusk, these groups dissolve, at dawn they may re-merge. So, what is a typical group size? And how long does a group use the same roost? We answer these questions by analyzing empirical data from two colonies. What is more, we also provide an agent-based model to reproduce these findings. See our paper here.</description></item><item><title>Improving the robustness of online social networks: A simulation approach of network interventions</title><link>/2019/11/improving-the-robustness-of-online-social-networks-a-simulation-approach-of-network-interventions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/11/improving-the-robustness-of-online-social-networks-a-simulation-approach-of-network-interventions/</guid><description>Online social networks (OSN) are prime examples of socio-technical systems in which individuals interact via a technical platform. We study the emergence of large drop-out cascades of users leaving the OSN by means of an agent-based model. Our aim is to prevent such drop-out cascades by influencing specific agents. We identify strategies to control agents such that drop-out cascades are significantly reduced, and the robustness of the OSN is increased. Read more on arXiv.</description></item></channel></rss>
