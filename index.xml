He is also associated member of the Department of Physics at the ETH Zurich.
Frank Schweitzer received his first Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) in theoretical physics at the age of 26, and his second Ph.D. (Dr. phil.) in philosophy of science at the age of 29, he further earned a habilitation/Venia Legendi in Physics. In his professional career, he worked for different research institutions (Max-Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Dresden, Fraunhofer Institute for Autonomous Intelligent Systems, Sankt Augustin) and universities (Humboldt University Berlin, Cornell University Ithaca NY, Emory University, Atlanta GA).</description></item><item><title>Agent-based Modelling of Social Systems</title><link>/teaching/abm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 21:43:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>/teaching/abm/</guid><description>Individuals live in groups! Their weave of dynamical and differentiated interactions results in complex societies, whose properties and ruling principles can only be fully unraveled when studying the underlying social system from a formal standpoint.
In this course, we use agent-based modelling as a bottom-up tool to study social systems. Agents have internal degrees of freedom (opinions, strategies), the ability to perceive and to change their environment, and to interact with other agents.</description></item><item><title/><link>/team/giacomo_vaccario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/giacomo_vaccario/</guid><description>My main interests are in the quantification of knowledge and of its exchange in academia and in R&amp;amp;D activities.
In particular, I concentrate on two specific classes of problems. The first class of problems is related to the question of how knowledge artifacts are linked to each other, ranked and filtered in repositories. Examples of repositories are patent and scientific publication databases. The second class of problems relates to the question of how knowledge is exchanged and transferred.</description></item><item><title/><link>/team/giona_casiraghi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/giona_casiraghi/</guid><description>Interests I am interested in network science, statistical methods focusing on the analysis of complex systems, resilience, data science in general, and snow.</description></item><item><title/><link>/team/laurence_brandenberger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/laurence_brandenberger/</guid><description>I study legislative behavior and parliamentary networks. I am particularly interested in the temporal dynamics of political actors working together, for instance looking at how long it takes for a member of parliament to reciprocate a favor by a colleague. Furthermore, I study how political actors change their political positions over time and influence each other.
As a quantitative social scientist, I use Relational Event Models (REMs), Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) and temporal variations thereof (so-called TERGMs or BTERGMs) and conventional regressions for my analyses.</description></item><item><title/><link>/team/luca_verginer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/luca_verginer/</guid><description>Luca Verginer is an economist working on subjects, covering

During my master thesis I applied inference methods and machine learning techniques to study human perception of facial beauty. Currently, my research interests focus on cascade processes, meaning that I am studying how a local shock, appeared in a system, affects its different parts. By adopting a network perspective I can measure the cascade size and try to identify the possible characteristics of the system that prevent a big cascade size.</description></item><item><title/><link>/team/christian_zingg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/christian_zingg/</guid><description>In my research, I study the effects that shocks have on the network structure of social systems. To examine structural changes, I define and analyze measures that are, for example, based on entropies. Having a theoretical background yet being interested in real-world problems, it is essential to me to discuss both theory and applications.
Before starting as a PhD at the Chair of Systems Design, I studied applied mathematics at the ETH Zurich.</description></item><item><title/><link>/team/christoph_gote/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/christoph_gote/</guid><description>Christoph Gote is a PhD Candidate at the Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

Currently, I focus on a temporal network model of letter correspondences during the European Reformation. I try to understand the underlying communication patterns which gave rise to the spreading of ideas at that time. Specifically challenging in this respect are the sampling bias of the data, as not all historical artifacts are equally likely to survive over time, and capturing the temporal sequence in which historical actions occurred.</description></item><item><title/><link>/team/georges_andres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/team/georges_andres/</guid><description>Interests My current research topics are centered around structural balance theory and opinion formation in social systems.

The revolution in measurement brought by our digital society gives us data at global scales, very high frequencies, and unprecedented levels of depth and resolution.
This course focuses both on the fundamentals and applications of Data Science in the Social Sciences, including technologies for data retrieval, processing, and analysis with the aim to derive insights that are interpretable from a wider theoretical perspective.</description></item><item><title>Systems Dynamics and Complexity</title><link>/teaching/system-dynamics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 21:43:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>/teaching/system-dynamics/</guid><description>The course encompasses a large range of approaches towards systems and their dynamics, with particular emphasis on problem solving. It starts from basic insights on why real problems are not simple but complex, and why systems do not always do what we expect.
Based on that, we introduce tools and methods commonly used in Systems Engineering (systems oriented management) and Project Management to analyse problems at large, to search for solutions and to optimize project scheduling.</description></item><item><title>CFP - Scientific Networks and Success</title><link>/2021/01/cfp-scientific-networks-and-success/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2021/01/cfp-scientific-networks-and-success/</guid><description>Researchers along with their research institutions are increasingly evaluated according to scientific performance metrics.

This includes conceptual issues of systems thinking and systems engineering, formalization of systems dynamics, as well as quantitative approaches for nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular, we apply various methods to investigate COMPLEX SYSTEMS which emanated over the last 30 years from different fields such as statistical physics, evolutionary biology, micro economics, or computational sciences.</description></item><item><title>Carousel 1</title><link>/carousel/car1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/carousel/car1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Title 3</title><link>/carousel/car2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/carousel/car2/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
