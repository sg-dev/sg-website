Their weave of dynamical and differentiated interactions results in complex societies, whose properties and ruling principles can only be fully unraveled when studying the underlying social system from a formal standpoint.
In this course, we use agent-based modelling as a bottom-up tool to study social systems. Agents have internal degrees of freedom (opinions, strategies), the ability to perceive and to change their environment, and to interact with other agents.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/georges_andres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/georges_andres/</guid><description>Interests My current research topics are centered around structural balance theory and opinion formation in social systems. During my Master&amp;rsquo;s in physics at the ETHZ I encountered the study of complex systems via network representations and agent based models.

Sophia&amp;rsquo;s research interests focus on political networks, in particular covering political polarization dynamics, the professionalization processes of parliaments, and in general the science-policy nexus.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/ambra_amico/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/ambra_amico/</guid><description>Before joining the Chair, I received a Master degree in physics at la Sapienza University in Rome, where I got interested in the complex systems field. During my master thesis I applied inference methods and machine learning techniques to study human perception of facial beauty. Currently, my research interests focus on cascade processes, namely I am studying how a local shock, appeared in a system, affects its different parts. By adopting a network perspective I can measure the cascade size and identify the possible characteristics of the system that prevent a big cascade size.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/christian_zingg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/christian_zingg/</guid><description>In my research, I study the effects that shocks have on the network structure of social systems. To examine structural changes, I define and analyze measures that are, for example, based on entropies. Having a theoretical background yet being interested in real-world problems, it is essential to me to discuss both theory and applications.
Before starting as a PhD at the Chair of Systems Design, I studied applied mathematics at the ETH Zurich.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/christoph_gote/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/christoph_gote/</guid><description>Christoph Gote is a PhD Candidate at the Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

Currently, I focus on a temporal network model of letter correspondences during the European Reformation. I try to understand the underlying communication patterns which gave rise to the spreading of ideas at that time. Specifically challenging in this respect are the sampling bias of the data, as not all historical artifacts are equally likely to survive over time, and capturing the temporal sequence in which historical actions occurred.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/giacomo_vaccario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/giacomo_vaccario/</guid><description>My main interests are in the quantification of knowledge and of its exchange in academia and in R&amp;amp;D activities.
In particular, I concentrate on two specific classes of problems. The first class of problems is related to the question of how knowledge artifacts are linked to each other, ranked and filtered in repositories. Examples of repositories are patent and scientific publication databases. The second class of problems relates to the question of how knowledge is exchanged and transferred.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/giona_casiraghi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/giona_casiraghi/</guid><description>Research Interests I work on two tighly connected topics. How to define and quantify resilience, in complex systems in general and in social organisations in particular. How to model complex systems from the data, to perform a data-driven study of their properties.
Resilience of Social Organisations We aim at an understanding of how different online social organisations withstand and recover from internal and external shocks, and how such a resilience can be improved.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/laurence_brandenberger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/laurence_brandenberger/</guid><description>I study legislative behavior and parliamentary networks. I am particularly interested in the temporal dynamics of political actors working together, for instance looking at how long it takes for a member of parliament to reciprocate a favor by a colleague. Furthermore, I study how political actors change their political positions over time and influence each other.
As a quantitative social scientist, I use Relational Event Models (REMs), Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) and temporal variations thereof (so-called TERGMs or BTERGMs) and conventional regressions for my analyses.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/luca_verginer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/luca_verginer/</guid><description>Luca Verginer is an economist working on subjects, covering

We examine the external validity of data on political behavior exhibited online and compare it to offline behavior. We overlay two data sets on political support among members of the Swiss parliament to estimate the explanatory power of online endorsements on offline cosponsorship signatures among members, using a gHypEG network regression model. Whereas offline support behavior is driven by a broad range of factors, such as network and homophily effects, online endorsement is less diverse.</description></item><item><title>Why Online does not Equal Offline: Comparing Online and Real-World Political Support Among Politicians.</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/brandenberger2021_onlineoffline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/brandenberger2021_onlineoffline/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Reproducing scientists' mobility: a data-driven model</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/vaccario2021reproducing-scientists-mobility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/vaccario2021reproducing-scientists-mobility/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Systems Design Bottom Up</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/design/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/design/</guid><description>Two short texts for the general audience explain the problems of systems design in complex systems:

As highlighted in Part 1 of our series on Summary Documents, we extract a lot of information from these documents. Most importantly, these documents are our baseline for the complete list of bills presented to parliament. They also include information about cosponsorship signatures, which can be used to study legislative collaborations and alliances.
In this blogpost we talk about the numbering of bills as well as presenting some exceptions that caused us some headaches when exporting and structuring their information.</description></item><item><title>Theory of social roles</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/theory_of_social_roles_in_networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/theory_of_social_roles_in_networks/</guid><description>Our new paper A new theory of social roles in networks is available now.
Individuals fulfill different social roles in different contexts. For example, a professor teaches in a lecture theatre and does research in the lab. Especially in large networks, this context is very heterogenous as local clusters form. If these clusters are not addressed role detection yields flawed results. We address the effect of clusters on roles in networks with a novel theory of social roles.</description></item><item><title>A new theory of social roles in networks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/roller2021a-new-theory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/roller2021a-new-theory/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Historical Network research lunch lecture</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/hnr_lunch_lecture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/hnr_lunch_lecture/</guid><description>Ramona Roller presents how to treat time in a letter correspondence network of the Reformation.
The Reformation is characterised by frequent letter correspondences between scholars which can be modeled as a network. Letters have sending dates, providing a temporal order for the spread of ideas and routes of influence. This temporal order of letters affects network measures and therefore has to be considered in network analyses. I show how to address this challenge by using pathpy a software to analyse temporal networks.</description></item><item><title>Summary Documents and the Secrets they Hold -- Part 1</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_4-summarydocs_part1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_4-summarydocs_part1/</guid><description>One of our main data sources for our Project 130 Years of Swiss Parliament (click here for the project overview) are so-called summary of proceedings documents.

Analyses of legislative behavior is often based on ideological positions (or policy preferences) of the involved actors, such as parties or individual members of parliament (MPs). These positions allow for detailed analysis on how political alliances are formed and leveraged to influence the decision-making process in their favour.</description></item><item><title>SDSC Project: DemocraSci</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_1-sdsc-project/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/swissparliament_1-sdsc-project/</guid><description>The goal of our research and data project DemocraSci is to create a searchable database of the Swiss Parliament. For the past 130 years (starting in 1891), the Swiss Parliament has carefully documented its actions and debates in the so-called Amtliches Bulletin&amp;mdash;a stenographic record of parliamentary speeches and legislative proposals. In our project we carefully extract and structure the data from the Amtliches Bulletin.
Our database will contain
all bills, legislative proposals and parliamentary questions brought forth by members of the parliament, comittees, parliamentary groups (called Fraktionen) and cantons (in the form of a Standesinitative) all speeches recorded in the Amtliches Bulletin all members passing through the parliament as well as their functions, their committee memberships and their involvement in parliamentary affairs all votes and voting outcomes for proposals all cosponsorship signatures from members of parliament on bills The project is a collaboration between our chair and the Swiss Data Science Center, SDSC.</description></item><item><title>Disclaimer</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/admin/disclaimer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 14:26:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/admin/disclaimer/</guid><description>General legal information Liability Although ETH Zurich takes all possible care to ensure the correctness of published information, no warranty can be accepted regarding the correctness, accuracy, uptodateness, reliability and completeness of the content of this information.

It starts from basic insights on why real problems are not simple but complex, and why systems do not always do what we expect.
Based on that, we introduce tools and methods commonly used in Systems Engineering (systems oriented management) and Project Management to analyse problems at large, to search for solutions and to optimize project scheduling.</description></item><item><title>Stem cell legislation and its impact on the geographic preferences of stem cell researchers</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/verginer2021stem-cell-legislation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/verginer2021stem-cell-legislation/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The likelihood-ratio test for multi-edge network models</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/casiraghi2021the-likelihoodratio-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/2021/casiraghi2021the-likelihoodratio-test/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Scientific Networks and Success</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/acs_call_for_papers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/news/acs_call_for_papers/</guid><description>Researchers along with their research institutions are increasingly evaluated according to scientific performance metrics. Yet how should they be measured? And is the required data available? Also, Modern research is predominantly a team endeavor in which success and failure strongly depends on social forces among collaborators driven by intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, behavior and strategy. Do we have the right models to account for these phenomena?

We show that for one information regime the critical bonus increases with the level of cooperation, while in a second regime the bonus decreases with the level of cooperation. In this second regime, full cooperation can be achieved once a cold-start problem is solved.

We use this relation to determine reputation spillovers between transnational companies and their participated companies in an ownership network core of 1318 firms. We then apply concepts of network controllability to identify minimum sets of driver nodes (MDS) of 314 firms in this network.

At dusk, these groups dissolve, at dawn they may re-merge. So, what is a typical group size? And how long does a group use the same roost? We answer these questions by analyzing empirical data from two colonies. What is more, we also provide an agent-based model to reproduce these findings.

We study the emergence of large drop-out cascades of users leaving the OSN by means of an agent-based model. Our aim is to prevent such drop-out cascades by influencing specific agents. We identify strategies to control agents such that drop-out cascades are significantly reduced, and the robustness of the OSN is increased.

This includes conceptual issues of systems thinking and systems engineering, formalization of systems dynamics, as well as quantitative approaches for nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular, we apply various methods to investigate COMPLEX SYSTEMS which emanated over the last 30 years from different fields such as statistical physics, evolutionary biology, micro economics, or computational sciences.</description></item><item><title>All Publications</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/all-publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/all-publications/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Carousel 1</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/carousel/car1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/carousel/car1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Frank Schweitzer - Editorial Boards</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/extra/fs/boards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/extra/fs/boards/</guid><description>EPJ Data Science Springer Open Editor-in-Chief, 2013 - The European Physical Journal B: Condensed Matter and Complex Systems EPJ Sciences Les Ulis Cedex A Editor, 2006 - 2007 Editor-in-Chief (Complex Systems), 2007 - 2012 External Advisors, 2012 - ACS - Advances in Complex Systems World Scientific Singapore Editor, 1998 - Editor-in-Chief, 2007 - Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination Springer Berlin Heidelberg Editor, 2005 - International Journal of Modern Physics C World Scientific Singapore Associate Editor, 2005 - Springer Complexity Springer Berlin Heidelberg Editorial and Programme Advisory Board, 2006 - Springer Series in Synergetics Springer Berlin Heidelberg Editorial and Programme Advisory Board, 2004- Selbstorganisation Jahrbuch für Komplexität in den Natur-, Sozial- und Geisteswissenschaften Duncker &amp;amp; Humblot Berlin Wissenschaftlicher Beirat, 1990 - 2000 Advisory Boards - [Institute for Scientific Interchange, Torino, Italy](http://www.</description></item><item><title>Frank Schweitzer - Short Bio</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/extra/fs/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/extra/fs/cv/</guid><description>Frank Schweitzer has been Full Professor for Systems Design at ETH Zurich since 2004.
