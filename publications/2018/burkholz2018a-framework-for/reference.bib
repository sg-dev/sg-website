Abstract = {We present a framework to calculate the cascade size evolution for a large class of cascade models
on random network ensembles in the limit of infinite network size. Our method is exact and applies
to network ensembles with almost arbitrary degree distribution, degree-degree correlations and, in
case of threshold models, for arbitrary threshold distribution. With our approach, we shift the
perspective from the known branching process approximations to the iterative update of suitable
probability distributions. Such distributions are key to capture cascade dynamics that involve
possibly continuous quantities and that depend on the cascade history, e.g. if load is accumulated
over time. As a proof of concept, we provide two examples: (a) Constant load models that cover
many of the analytically tractable casacade models, and, as a highlight, (b) a fiber bundle model
that was not tractable by branching process approximations before. Our derivations cover the whole
cascade dynamics, not only their steady state. This allows to include interventions in time or further
model complexity in the analysis.},
