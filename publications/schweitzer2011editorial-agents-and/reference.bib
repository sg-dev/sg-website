    abstract = "The agent concept is one of the very few concepts which have been able to cross the borders of scientiﬁc disciplines, ﬁnding applications not only in computer science and artiﬁcial intelligence, but also in biology, economics, engineering, and the social sciences. Thus it is only natural that the research frontiers in this fast growing ﬁeld develop along interdisciplinary problems. These include the ability of agents to evolve, e.g. through adaptation and learning, but also the emergence of systemic properties which result from the interplay of large numbers of agents, rather than from carefully designed single agent behavior.",
