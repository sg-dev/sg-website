    abstract = "When dealing with networks of several kind, network theory provides the theoretical framework and the practical tools to analyze them. Mostly analysis focuses on steady networks, i.e. networks with ﬁxed topology. However, real - world scenarios often deal with (highly) dynamic topologies. As of today, the question of how to investigate such scenarios, e.g. deﬁning a meaningful notion of “temporal centrality”, has generally not been answered. In this poster we present research pointing out the obstacles arising in this endeavor as well as a possible framework to address those issues, which we call time - explicit graphs.",
