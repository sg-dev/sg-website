    abstract = "We investigate to what extent the interaction dynamics of a population of wild
house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) in their environment can be explained
by a simple stochastic model. We use a Markov chain model to describe the transitions
of mice in a discrete space of nestboxes, and implement a multi-agent simulation of the
model. We find that some important features of our behavioural dataset can be
reproduced using this simplified stochastic representation, and discuss
the improvements that could be made to our model in order to increase the accuracy
of its predictions. Our findings have implications for the understanding of the
complexity underlying social behaviour in the animal kingdom and the cognitive
requirements of such behaviour."
