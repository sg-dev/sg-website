    abstract = "Past years have witnessed a growing interest in automated negotiation as a coordination mechanism for interacting agents. This paper presents a generic, problem-and domain-independent frame-work for argumentation-based negotiation that covers both essential agent-internal and external components relevant to automated negotia-tion. This framework, called Negotiation Situation Specification Scheme (N3S), is both suited as a guideline for implementing negotiation sce-narios as well as integrating available approaches that address selective aspects of negotiation. In particular, N3S contributes to the state of the art in automated negotiation by identifying and relating basic argument types and negotiation stages in a structured and formal way.",
