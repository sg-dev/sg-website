    abstract = "The social percolation model (Solomon et al., 2000) considers a 2-dimensional regular lattice. Each site is occupied by an agent with a preference $x\_{i}$ sampled from a uniform distribution $U[0,1]$. Agents transfer the information about the quality $q$ of a movie to their neighbors only if $x\_{i}\leq q$.  Information percolates through the lattice if $q=q\_{c}=0.593$. --  From a network perspective the percolating cluster can be seen as a random-regular network with $n\_{c}$ nodes and a mean degree that depends on $q\_{c}$.  Preserving these quantities of the random-regular network, a true random network can be generated from the $G(n,p)$ model after determining the link probability $p$.  I then demonstrate how this random network can be transformed into a threshold network, where agents create links dependent on their $x\_{i}$ values.   Assuming a dynamics of the $x\_{i}$ and a mechanism of group formation, I further extend the model toward an adaptive social network model.",
