    abstract = "Affect Listeners are applied as tools for studying the role of emotions in online communication. They need to interact both in dyads as well as in group settings with multiple users. In this paper, we present the evolution of such affective dialog systems from a focus on dyadic interaction to multi-party interaction on chat networks. Starting from experiments on the use of these dialog systems in virtual dyadic settings, we outline the requirements, design and implementation decisions necessary to apply the systems to affective interactions with multiple users. Finally, we introduce two realisations of Interactive Affective Bots designed for such interaction scenarios that integrate modelling of individuals and groups as part of their decision mechanism.",
