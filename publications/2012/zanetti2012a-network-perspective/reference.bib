    abstract = "Modularity is a desirable characteristic for software systems. In this article we propose to use a quantitative method from complex network sciences to estimate the coherence between the modularity of the dependency network of large open source Java projects and their decomposition in terms of Java packages. The results presented in this article indicate that our methodology offers a promising and reasonable quantitative approach with potential impact on software engineering processes.",
