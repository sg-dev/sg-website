    abstract = "In this paper, we propose a simple randomized
protocol for identifying trusted nodes based on personalized
trust in large scale distributed networks. The problem of
identifying trusted nodes, based on personalized trust, in a
large network setting stems from the huge computation and
message overhead involved in exhaustively calculating and
propagating the trust estimates by the remote nodes. However,
in any practical scenario, nodes generally communicate with
a small subset of nodes and thus exhaustively estimating the
trust of all the nodes can lead to huge resource consumption.
In contrast, our mechanism can be tuned to locate a desired
subset of trusted nodes, based on the allowable overhead, with
respect to a particular user. The mechanism is based on a
simple exchange of random walk messages and nodes counting
the number of times they are being hit by random walkers
of nodes in their neighborhood. Simulation results to analyze
the effectiveness of the algorithm show that using the proposed
algorithm, nodes identify the top trusted nodes in the network
with a very high probability by exploring only around 45\% of
the total nodes, and in turn generates nearly 90\% less overhead
as compared to an exhaustive trust estimation mechanism,
named TrustWebRank. Finally, we provide a measure of the
global trustworthiness of a node; simulation results indicate
that the measures generated using our mechanism differ by
only around 0.6\% as compared to TrustWebRank.",
