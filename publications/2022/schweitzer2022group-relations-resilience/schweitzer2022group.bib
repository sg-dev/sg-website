  abstract =	 {We evaluate the robustness and adaptivity of social groups with heterogeneous
                  agents that are characterized by their binary state, their ability to change this
                  state, their status and their preferred relations to other agents.  To define
                  group structures, we operationalize the hexagrams of the \emph{I Ching}.  The
                  relations and properties of agents are used to quantify their influence according
                  to the social impact theory.  From these influence values we derive a weighted
                  stability measure for triads involving three agents, which is based on the
                  weighted balance theory.  It allows to quantify the robustness of groups and to
                  propose a novel measure for group resilience which combines robustness and
                  adaptivity.  A stochastic approach determines the probabilities to find robust and
                  adaptive groups.  The discussion focuses on the generalization of our approach.},
