    abstract = "In the U.S. Congress, legislators can use active and passive cosponsorship to support bills.We show that these two types of cosponsorship are driven by two different motivations: the backing of political colleagues and the backing of the bill{'}s content.To this end, we develop an Encoder+RGCN based model that learns legislator representations from bill texts and speech transcripts. These representations predict active and passive cosponsorship with an F1-score of 0.88.Applying our representations to predict voting decisions, we show that they are interpretable and generalize to unseen tasks.",
