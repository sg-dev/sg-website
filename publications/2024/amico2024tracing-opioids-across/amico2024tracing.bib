In the field of pharmaceutical supply chains, there is a lack of comprehensive historical data, representing a significant barrier to advancing research. To address this gap, we introduce a high-resolution dataset comprising drug packages distributed to approximately 300,000 pharmacies, hospitals, and practitioners across the US. We reconstruct 375 million distribution paths from ARCOS, a DEA-maintained database comprising half a billion shipping records between 2006 and 2014. While ARCOS tracks dyadic shipments, it does not provide information on the complete journey of single packages from manufacturers to final destinations. Our algorithm is able to reconstruct complete distribution paths from these dyadic records. The reconstructed dataset, with its high temporal and spatial resolution, offers an unprecedented view of US pharmaceutical distribution and is a valuable resource for investigating supply and distribution networks.
