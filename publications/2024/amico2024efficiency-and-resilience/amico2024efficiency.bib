	abstract = {Networks to distribute goods, from raw materials to food and medicines, are the
backbone of a functioning economy. They are shaped by several supply relations
connecting manufacturers, distributors, and ﬁnal buyers worldwide. We present a
network-based model to describe the mechanisms underlying the emergence and
growth of distribution networks. In our model, ﬁrms consider two practices when
establishing new supply relations: centralization, the tendency to choose highly
connected partners, and multi-sourcing, the preference for multiple suppliers.
Centralization enhances network eﬃciency by leveraging short distribution paths;
multi-sourcing fosters resilience by providing multiple distribution paths connecting
ﬁnal buyers to the manufacturer. We validate the proposed model using data on drug
shipments in the US. Drawing on these data, we reconstruct 22 nationwide
pharmaceutical distribution networks. We demonstrate that the proposed model
successfully replicates several structural features of the empirical networks, including
their out-degree and path length distributions as well as their resilience and eﬃciency
properties. These ﬁndings suggest that the proposed ﬁrm-level practices eﬀectively
capture the network growth process that leads to the observed structures.},
