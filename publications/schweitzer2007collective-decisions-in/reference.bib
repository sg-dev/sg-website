    abstract = "Decision making, in a simple sense, means a selection among alternatives. It is one of the fundamental processes in economics but also in social systems. If these systems consist of many interacting elements — which we call agents here — the system dynamics may be described on two different levels: the microscopic level, where the decisions of the individual agents occur and the macroscopic level where a certain collective behavior can be observed.",
