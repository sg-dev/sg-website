<dt> <b>Abstract:</b>
<dd> 
  Biological motion, human traffic and many other types of active motion
  rely on the supply of energy. In order to derive a rather general
  approach for active motion, we have proposed a model of active Brownian
  particles, which have the ability to take up energy from their
  environment, to store it in an internal energy depot and to convert
  internal energy to perform different activities, such as metabolism,
  acceleration of motion, changes of the environment, or signal-response
  behavior. The basic description is given by an extended Langevin
  equation for the motion of the particles, which is coupled to a balance
  equation for the internal energy depot.  Different to the case of
  passive Brownian motion, we find several new features of the dynamics,
  such as non-equilibrium velocity distributions, uphill motion,
  transitions between Brownian and directed motion, or excited collective
  motion and spontaneous rotations in an ensemble of active particles.
