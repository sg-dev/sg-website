<h2>Foreword by <A href="http://www.santafe.edu/~jdf"
Target=blank>J. Doyne Farmer</A></h2>

<p>
When we contemplate phenomena as diverse as electrochemical deposition
or the spatial patterns of urban development, the natural assumption
is that they have nothing in common.  After all, there are many levels
in the hierarchy that builds up from atoms to human society, and the
rules that govern atoms are quite different from those that govern the
geographical emergence of a city.  The common view among many if not
most biologists and social scientists is that the devil is entirely in
the details.  This school of thought asserts that social science and
biology have little or nothing in common, and indeed, many biologists
assert that even different fields of biology have little in common.
If they are right, then science can only proceed by recording vast
lists of details that no common principles will ever link together.
</p>
<p>
Physics, in contrast, has achieved a parsimonius description for a
broad range of phenomena based on only a few general principles.  The
phenomena that physics addresses are unquestionably much simpler than
those of biology or social science, and on the surface appear entirely
dissimilar.  A cell is far more complicated than a pendulum or an
atom, and human society, being built out of a great many cells, is far
more complicated still.  Cells and societies have many layers of
hierarchical organization, with complex functional and computational
properties; they have identities, idiosyncracies stemming from an
accumulation of historical contingency that makes them impossible to
characterize in simple mathematical terms.  Their complexity is far
beyond that of the simple systems usually studied in physics.  So, how
can methods from physics conceivably be of any use?
</p>
<p>
The answer, as demonstrated by Frank Schweitzer in this book, lies in
the fact that the essence of many phenomena do not depend on all their
details.  From the study of complex systems we have now accumulated a
wealth of examples that demonstrate how simple components with simple
interaction rules can give rise to complex emergent behaviors. This
book shows this sometimes applies even when the components are
themselves quite complicated.  This is because, for some purposes,
only a few of their features are relevant, and the complexity of the
collective behavior emerges from the interactions of these few simple
features alone.  So although individual people are very complicated,
and their decisions about where to live may be based on complicated,
idiosyncratic factors, it may nonetheless be possible to understand
certain statistical properties of the geographic layout of a city in
terms of simple models based on a few simple rules.  Furthermore, with
only minor modifications of these rules, the same explanatory
framework can be used to understand the dendritic patterns for zinc
deposits in an electric field.  It is particularly striking that such
disparate phenomena can be explained using the same theoretical
tools.  We have long known in physics that many different phenomena
can be explained with similar mathematics.  For example, the equations
that describe simple electric circuits consisting of resistors,
inductors, and capacitors are precisely the same as those describing a
system of masses and springs.  This work shows that such mathematical
analogies apply even more broadly than one might have suspected.
</p>
<p>
In the middle of the 20th century, John von Neumann said that "science
and technology will shift from a past emphasis on motion, force, and
energy to communication, organization, programming and control".  This
has already begun to happen, but as we enter the 21st century, the
scientific program for understanding complex systems is still in its
infancy.  We are still experimenting to find the right theoretical
tools.  One of the obvious candidates for a starting point is
statistical mechanics.  This is a natural suggestion because
statistical mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with
organization and disorganization.  One example where this has already
succeeded is information theory.  Claude Shannon showed how entropy,
which was originally conceived for understanding the relationship
between heat, work, and temperature, could be generalized to measure
information in an abstract setting, and used for practical purposes
such as the construction of an efficient communication channel.  So
perhaps there are other extensions of statistical mechanics that can be
used to understand the remarkable range of emergent behaviors
exhibited by many diverse complex systems.
</p>
<p>
But the reality is that classical statistical mechanics is mostly
about disorganization.  A typical model in statistical mechanics
treats atoms as structureless ping pong balls.  A classic example is
Brownian motion: When a particle is suspended in a fluid, it is
randomly kicked by the atoms of the fluid, and makes a random walk.
This example played a pivotal role in proving that the world was made
of atoms, and helped make it possible to quantitatively understand the
relationship between macroscopic properties such as friction and
microscopic properties such as molecular collisions.  It led to the
development of the theory of random processes, which has proved to be
extremely useful in many other settings. 
</p>
<p>
The framework that Schweitzer develops here extends that of Brownian
motion by making the particles suspended in the fluid just a little
more complicated.  The particles become {\it Brownian agents}, with 
internal states.  They can store energy and information and they can
sense their environment and respond to it.  They can change their
internal states contingently depending on their environment, or based
on their interactions with each other.  These extra features endow
them with simple computational capabilities.  They are smarter than
ping pong balls, but no smarter than they need to be.  By adjusting
parameters, the behavior can vary from purely stochastic at one
extreme to purely deterministic at the other.  Schweitzer shows that
even when the Brownian agents are quite simple, through their direct
and indirect interactions with each other they can exhibit quite
complex behaviors.
</p>
<p>
Brownian agents can be used in many different contexts, ranging from
atomic physics to macroeconomics.  In this book, Schweitzer
systematically develops the power of the Brownian agent model and
shows how it can be applied to a wide range of problems, from molecule
to mind.  At the lowest level they can be simple atoms or molecules,
with internal states such as excitation, and simple rules of
interaction corresponding to chemical reactions.  They can be used to
describe the properties of molecular motors and ratchets.  Or they can
be cells or single-celled organisms responding to stimuli, such as
electric fields, light, or chemical gradients.  They can be used to
study the group feeding properties of bark beetle larvae, or the trail
formation of ants creating and responding to pheromone signals.  With
just a few changes in the model, they can be pedestrians forming
trails based on visual queues, or automobile drivers stuck in traffic.
Or they can be voters forming opinions by talking to their neighbors,
or workers deciding where to work in a factory.
</p>
<p>
Agent based modeling is one of the basic tools that has emerged in
recent years for the study of complex systems.  The basic idea is to
encapsulate the behavior of the interacting units of a complex system
in simple programs that constitute self-contained interacting modules.
Unfortunately, however, all too often agent based modelers lack
self-restraint, and create agents that are excessively complicated.
This results in models whose behavior can be as difficult to
understand as the systems they are intended to study.  One ends up not
knowing what properties are generic, and which properties are unwanted
side-effects.
</p>
<p>
This work takes just the opposite approach, by including only features
that are absolutely necessary.  It demonstrates that agent based
modeling is not just for computer simulation.  By keeping the agents
sufficiently simple, it is also possible to develop a theoretical
framework that sometimes gives rise to analytic results, and that
provides a mental framework for modeling and interpreting the results
of simulations when analytic methods fail.  By insisting on parsimony,
it adheres to the modeling style that has been the key to the success
of physics (and that originally motivated the rational expectations
equilibrium model in economics).
</p>
<p>
This book lays out a vision for a coherent framework for understanding
complex systems.  However, it should be viewed as a beginning rather
than an end.  There is still a great deal to be done in making more
detailed connections to real problems, and in making quantitative,
falsifiable predictions.  Despite the wide range of problems discussed
here, I suspect that this is only a small subset of the possibilities
where the Brownian agent method can be applied.  While I don't think
that Brownian agents will gain a monopoly on theoretical modeling in
complex systems, this book does a major service by introducing this
new tool and demonstrating its generality and power in a wide range of
diverse applications.  This work will likely have an important
influence on complex systems modeling in the future.  And perhaps most
important, it adds to the unity of knowledge by showing how phenomena
in widely different areas can be addressed within a common
mathematical framework, and showing that for some purposes, most of
the details can be ignored.
