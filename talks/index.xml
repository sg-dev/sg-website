Another pervasive pattern encountered in the same kinds of networks is transitivity, i.</description></item><item><title>Data Science on Knowledge Graphs: from Complex Data to Network Models</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/talk_2022_casiraghi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/talk_2022_casiraghi/</guid><description>Abstract One of the most typical properties of network data is the presence of homophily, i.e. the increased tendency of an edge to exist between two nodes if they share the same underlying characteristic, such as a social parameter, metabolic role, etc. More broadly, when the underlying similarity parameter is not specified a priori, the same homophily pattern is known as community structure.

However, we increasingly have access to time-resolved data that not only capture which nodes are connected to each other, but also when and in which temporal order those connections occur. A number of works have shown how the timing and ordering of links shapes the causal topology of networked systems, i.</description></item><item><title>Measuring the impact of content moderation</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2022-ribeiro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2022-ribeiro/</guid><description>Abstract In my talk, I will discuss two recent papers that draw causal conclusions on the effectiveness of content moderation from observational data. First, I will present results from a fuzzy regression discontinuity design analyzing the effect of automated content moderation on Facebook. Exploiting the arbitrary machine-learning thresholds used by Facebook&amp;rsquo;s moderation system, I will show how automated content moderation reduces subsequent rule-breaking behavior. Second, I will present the results of a difference-in-differences design studying the impact of deplatforming Parler (following the Jan 6 capitol attack) on the consumption of fringe content online.</description></item><item><title>Quotebank: Studying Society through the Lens of Quotations</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2022-west/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2022-west/</guid><description>Abstract I will present Quotebank, a publicly available, Web-scale corpus of 178 million speaker-attributed quotations extracted from 196 million English news articles published between August 2008 and April 2020. After introducing the dataset, I will highlight several studies in which Quotebank was used to study the U.S. political landscape, showing, e.g., that negativity among U.S. politicians has increased, and that the objectivity of U.S. news has decreased, in recent years. In addition to showcasing our own research, I hope the talk will inspire further applications of Quotebank for computational social science.</description></item><item><title>‚òïÔ∏è Coffee Break ü•ê</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2022sg_symposium_cbreak/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2022sg_symposium_cbreak/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
