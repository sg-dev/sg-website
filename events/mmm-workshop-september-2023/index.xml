Despite the relevance of algorithms and opinion formation mechanisms to modern-day political discourse, the structure and dynamics of polarized states in digital spaces are still poorly understood.
In this talk I‚Äôll introduce a general theoretical framework to systematically link models of opinion dynamics, social network structure, and content filtering, allowing us to pinpoint what type of social interactions are robust against algorithmic bias, and which ones are susceptible to bias-enhanced opinion polarization.</description></item><item><title>An Empirical and Simulation Investigation of Bounded Confidence and Negative Influence in Opinion Dynamics using Stochastic Actor-Oriented Model</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/tang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/tang/</guid><description>Abstract Classic opinion dynamics models of assimilation fail to shed light on opinion clustering and polarization. Two micro-processes of social influence, bounded confidence and negative influence, have been proposed as solutions. Empirical evidence for bounded confidence and negative influence is debatable. Two common drawbacks in existing empirical studies are (1) lab experiments that lack external validity; and (2) model designs that do not allow disentangling negative influence from bounded confidence, as well as other social influence mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>Closing and Farewell</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/closing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/closing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Democratic backsliding, attitudes towards democracy and affective polarization</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/wunsch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/wunsch/</guid><description>Abstract Affective polarization and partisanship have been posited as a key explanation for citizens‚Äôtolerance towards democratic backsliding, with voters more likely to overlook democratic violations conducted by in-party candidates. Our study adopts a novel perspective on this relationship: focusing on the role of the opposition, we contend that backsliding may crystallize anaffective dislike among opposition supporters towards the governing party and its supporters that stems from a regime divide over democracy itself.</description></item><item><title>Depolarizing effect of strategic anticonformity ‚Äì insights from the three-state ùëû-voter model with bounded confidence</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/weron/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/weron/</guid><description>Abstract Engaging with dissenting views, fostering productive disagreements, or strategic anticonformity can bring benefits to organizations by challenging the status quo. However, a key question arises regarding whether such strategic anticonformity ultimately leads to social polarization, which is an undesirable outcome. Previous research in computational social science indicates that conformity combined with homophily enhances polarization, while anticonformity towards dissimilar individuals further escalates it. However, it is worth noting that anticonformity is not limited to dissimilar individuals and can manifest in various forms, one of which is asserting uniqueness.</description></item><item><title>How assimilative and idiosyncratic attitude change generate oscillations of public policy mood</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/lorenz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/lorenz/</guid><description>Abstract The ideological attitudes of the general public in the US show two characteristics in their temporal evolution. When measured by self-identification, the distribution stays almost constant with a large moderate peak and a tendency for smaller and blurred liberal and conservative peaks. When conceptualized and measured as public policy mood instead, they oscillate almost regularly. We reproduce both phenomena in an agent-based model. In the model, agents repeatedly adjust their position either idiosyncratically but more often through assimilative attitude change towards the positions of others whenever these positions are within a latitude of acceptance.</description></item><item><title>Introduction of Participants</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/introduction/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Lunch Break</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_dh/lbreak_1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_dh/lbreak_1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Lunch Break</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/lbreak_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/lbreak_2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Multidimensional party polarization in Europe: Cross-cutting divides and effective dimensionality</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/steenbergen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/steenbergen/</guid><description>Abstract Ideological polarization matters. It is a necessary requirement for meaningful electoral competition, but at its extreme can strain democratic functioning. The conceptualization and measurement of contemporary ideological polarization is complicated by the growing complexity of the policy differences between political parties. Yet, existing indicators remain one-dimensional in nature, despite the wide acceptance of the multidimensional structure of European politics.
To resolve this tension, we introduce a novel, two-dimensional measure of party polarization.</description></item><item><title>On the design of public debate in social networks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/gabrisch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/gabrisch/</guid><description>Abstract We propose a model of the joint evolution of opinions and social relationshipsin a setting where social influence decays over time. The dynamics are based on bounded confidence: social connections between individuals with distant opinionsare severed while new connections are formed between individuals with similar opinions. Our model naturally gives raise to strong diversity, i.e., the persistenceof heterogeneous opinions in connected societies, a phenomenon that most existingmodels fail to capture.</description></item><item><title>Polarisation in the bounded confidence model: A revised view</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/hegselmann/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/hegselmann/</guid><description>Abstract The bounded confidence model (BC model) is a very simple model: Period by period, all agents average over all opinions that are no further away from their actual opinion than a given distance epsilon, their &amp;lsquo;bounded confidence&amp;rsquo;. It was introduced by Hegselmann and Krause in [2002].
According to the analysis at that time, it appeared that BC processes monotonically lead to a decreasing number of final clusters as the confidence interval (given by epsilon) increases.</description></item><item><title>Polarization as a Threat to Democracy?</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/session01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/session01/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Polarization Metrics and Opinions Inference in Multipolar Systems</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/benito/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/benito/</guid><description>Abstract Based on the idea that a population is perfectly polarized when divided in two groups of the same size and contrasting opinions, we propose a general methodology to study and measure the emergence of polarization from social interactions.
We will present polarization metrics to opinion distributions. In particular, we propose the polarization index [1] for bipolar systems. This metric is very restrictive since the maximum value is only achieved when the two conditions (groups of the same size and with contrasting opinions), are fulfilled.</description></item><item><title>Test title</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/session02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/session02/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Tracing the Sources of Belief Contestation in Policy Debates</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/leifeld/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/leifeld/</guid><description>Abstract Political actors agree or disagree with other actors on policy beliefs. When aggregated into a policy subsystem, advocacy coalitions with distinct belief systems emerge from actors' individual policy belief portfolios. Discourse network analysis measures coalitions by considering actors' stated beliefs. But policy beliefs differ in how important they are in structuring coalitions. To understand the ideational &amp;ldquo;glue&amp;rdquo; that binds coalitions together or keeps them apart in any given subsystem, we must identify the joint subset of beliefs that is structurally most important for the coalition structure.</description></item><item><title>Unpacking polarization: Antagonism and Alignment in Signed Networks of Online Interaction</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/garcia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/garcia/</guid><description>Abstract Online polarization research currently focuses on studying single-issue opinion distributions or computing distance metrics of interaction network structures. Limited data availability often restricts studies to positive interaction data, which can misrepresent the reality of a discussion. We introduce a novel framework that aims at combining these three aspects, content and interactions, as well as their nature (positive or negative), while challenging the prevailing notion of polarization as an umbrella term for all forms of online conflict or opposing opinions.</description></item><item><title>Welcome and Introductory Remarks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/schweitzer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/schweitzer/</guid><description>Abstract Polarization is studied in different disciplines. For the workshop, we aim at combining research on that topic from computational social science and political science, sociophysics and complexity science.
Each of these disciplines provides a unique perspective: Social and political scientists discuss the reasons and consequences for increasing polarization on various levels of society. Political scientists, in particular, study how this dynamics manifest itself in parliamentary processes, with the US Congress as a prime example.</description></item><item><title>Why can‚Äôt we go back to paradise?</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/holyst/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/holyst/</guid><description>Abstract According to the structural balance theory a social network is in an equilibrium state when it is divided into two communities and there are friendly links inside communities and hostile links between them. Then rules ‚Äúfriend of my friend is my friend‚Äù and ‚Äúenemy of my friend is my enemy‚Äù etc are fulfilled. Such a configuration corresponds to the social polarization and can be a result (for example) of segregating ideologies or opposing interests existing in both communities.</description></item><item><title>XXX</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/andres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/andres/</guid><description>Abstract Relevant publications Titel</description></item><item><title>XXX</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/faqeeh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/faqeeh/</guid><description>Abstract Relevant publications Titel</description></item><item><title>XXX</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/flache/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/flache/</guid><description>Abstract Relevant publications Titel</description></item><item><title>XXX</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/olbrich/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/olbrich/</guid><description>Abstract Relevant publications Titel</description></item><item><title>XXX</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/schlosser/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/schlosser/</guid><description>Abstract Relevant publications Titel</description></item><item><title>XXX</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/wagner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/wagner/</guid><description>Abstract Relevant publications Titel</description></item><item><title>‚òïÔ∏è Coffee Break ü•ê</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/cbreak_1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/cbreak_1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>‚òïÔ∏è Coffee Break ü•ê</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/cbreak_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/cbreak_2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>‚òïÔ∏è Coffee Break ü•ê</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/cbreak_3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/cbreak_3/</guid><description/></item><item><title>‚òïÔ∏è Coffee Break ü•ê</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/cbreak_4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/cbreak_4/</guid><description/></item><item><title>‚òïÔ∏è Coffee Break ü•ê</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/cbreak_5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2023_mmm/cbreak_5/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
