&lt;p>This presentation delves into the rich landscape of signed
networks, approaching the intricate positive and negative
relationships that shape social dynamics, including
phenomena like polarization and evolving social
ties. Offering a dual perspective on theory and dynamics,
the first part of the talk will focus on the theoretical
complexities of polarization, introducing the &amp;ldquo;Multiscale
Semiwalk Balance&amp;rdquo; approach. This methodology addresses
computational challenges, providing scalable insights into
balance degrees within real-world social systems. Shifting
the lens, the second part of the talk will discuss
navigating through the dynamics of high school social
relations, investigating the interplay of Structural Balance
(SB) and stochastic mechanisms. A continuous time model,
integrating cognitive constraints, is presented to
faithfully replicate observed network dynamics. This talk
bridges theoretical nuances and practical applications,
shedding light on key aspects of signed networks and their
implications for social relations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assessing frustration in real-world signed networks: towards a statistical theory of balance</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/gallo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/gallo/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pdfpresentation-gallopdf">&lt;a href="Presentation-Gallo.pdf">Presentation Slides (PDF)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The abundance of data about social and economic relationships has opened an era in which social theories can be tested against empirical evidence, allowing human behaviour to be analysed like other natural phenomena. Here we focus on balance theory [1], which postulates coherence between positive and negative interactions in real, social networks.
To make balance theory testable, one needs 1) a proper representation of social networks, 2) a definition of &amp;ldquo;frustration&amp;rdquo; (or imbalance) and 3) a set of null models to quantify the statistical significance of the latter. The first two ingredients have been already explored comprehensively: social interactions can be represented via signed graphs and &amp;ldquo;frustrated&amp;rdquo; configurations are defined as those having cycles with an odd number of negative links. The third ingredient, however, is way less developed, since the existing null models typically do not account for the different, intrinsic tendencies of individual actors to establish positive and negative interactions. To reduce this gap, here we extend the ERG framework to binary, undirected, signed networks with both global and local constraints. Moreover, we define two variants for each benchmark: one where the topology is kept fixed and one where it is left to vary along with the edge signs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Binary Models for Opinion Dynamics and Interpersonal Relationships via Influence and Homophily Mechanisms</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/pasquale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/pasquale/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pdfpresentation-pasqualepdf">&lt;a href="Presentation-Pasquale.pdf">Presentation Slides (PDF)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In this talk we propose two discrete time binary models for opinion dynamics.
The first one is based on the homophily mechanism.
We show that the binary homophily model can drive an initially structurally unbalanced network towards a socially balanced one.
In order to characterise non-structurally balanced equilibrium points, we introduce a (V,Œ£)-factorization that finds
an interesting interpretation in terms of structurally balanced sub-classes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second one is a revisitation of a recently proposed discrete time model for the interplay between homophily-based appraisal dynamics and
influence-based opinion dynamics.
We show that a simplified (and, in some situations, more feasible) version of the model, that accounts only for the signs of the agents‚Äô
appraisals provides an equally accurate and effective model of the opinion dynamics in small networks.
The equilibria reached by our model correspond, almost surely, to situations in which the agents‚Äô network is complete and structurally balanced.
On the other hand, we ensure that such equilibria can always be reached in a finite number of steps, and,
differently from the original model, we rule out other types of equilibria that correspond to disconnected social networks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Closing and Farewell</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/holyst/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/holyst/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Collective decision-making on networked systems: From social networks to political decision-making</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/fontan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/fontan/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Collective decision-making refers to a process in which the agents of a community exchange opinions to reach a common decision. It is often assumed that a collective decision is reached through collaboration among individuals. However, in many contexts, concerning for instance collective human behavior, it is more realistic to assume that the agents can collaborate or compete with each other. In this case, different types of collective behavior can be observed. This talk will focus on collective decision-making and will present a concrete example of political decision-making. I will present a nonlinear model for collective decision-making in a community of agents where both cooperative and antagonistic interactions coexist, represented as a signed interaction graph. The aim is to shed light on the role of frustration of the signed network (quantifying the amount of social tension in the network) in the decision-making process. A concrete example of the findings to the process of government formation in parliamentary democracies will be discussed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conference Dinner -- Restaurant Linde, Universit√§tstrasse 91</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/confbreak/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/confbreak/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Critical properties of Heider balance on multiplex networks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/mohandas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/mohandas/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pdfpresentation-mohandaspdf">&lt;a href="Presentation-Mohandas.pdf">Presentation Slides (PDF)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Heider&amp;rsquo;s structural balance theory has proven invaluable in comprehending the dynamics of social groups characterized by both friendly and hostile relationships. Since people&amp;rsquo;s relations are rarely single-faceted, we investigate Heider balance dynamics on a multiplex network, consisting of several copies of the same agent displaying correlated relations at different layers building the multiplex. Intralayer interactions in our model adhere to Heider dynamics, while interlayer correlations stem from Ising interactions, with the heat bath dynamics of link signs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction of Participants</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/introduction/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Keynote: How diadic homophilic relations cause structural balance</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/thurner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/thurner/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pptxpresentation-thurnerpptx">&lt;a href="Presentation-Thurner.pptx">Presentation Slides (PPTX)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>We present a simple model of a society where individuals are represented as a vector of opinions. Individuals are connected to each other in a temporal network where signed links represent a positive or negative relation between them. In a co-evolutionary dynamic setup individuals can change their opinions or change link signs. The model is phrased as a spinglas model. We study the phase diagram of the corresponding Hamiltonian and find that the ‚Äútriad-statistics‚Äù that is expected from structural balance is obtained for specific parameter values. We compare the theoretical results to data obtained from actual social networks. The exciting result is that homophilic (diadic) relations are fulle sufficient to explain the emergence of realistic social balance ‚Äì a triangle based statistics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keynote: Political Polarization At the Age of Social Media</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/szymanski/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/szymanski/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We all agree that social media has changed the way political
information spreads across the internet, but there is
paucity of research on how exactly this new way of spreading
works. In this talk, we will start by discussing the new
patterns of data flow and new roles for users in spreading
information and this new model coexists with remnants of the
classic two-level propagation. Then, using the polarization
model inspired by the Ising model, we discuss how the
presence of social media increases polarization. Political
scientists have documented increasing partisan division,
finding extremist positions to be more pronounced among
political elites than among voters, raising the question of
how polarization might be attenuated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keynote: Structural analysis of signed networks by optimally clustering them using integer programming models</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/aref/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/aref/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pdfpresentation-arefpdf">&lt;a href="Presentation-Aref.pdf">Presentation Slides (PDF)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>A signed network is one with positive and negative edges. We
analyze signed networks from the perspective of balance
theory. A signed network is strongly balanced (weakly
balanced) if its nodes can be partitioned into k‚â§2 clusters
(k clusters) such that positive edges are within the
clusters and negative edges are between the clusters. We use
mathematical programming models to optimally cluster the
nodes of a network by minimizing the total number of
intra-cluster negative and inter-cluster positive edges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keynote: The Shallowness of Deep Division</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/macy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/macy/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Computational models reveal a tipping point in political
polarization beyond which there is a potentially
irreversible phase transition characterized by asymmetric
hysteresis trajectories and triadic balance.The cascade
dynamics display two disturbing properties: opinions become
aligned across seemingly disparate political and cultural
dimensions, and existential threats to shared interests
(like a lethal pandemic, catastrophic global warming, or
aggression by a foreign adversary) have a divisive rather
than unifying effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This unraveling of the social fabric suggests partisan divisions that are deeply rooted in opposing interests and ideologies. However, an RCT experiment suggests it may be the other way around. What appear to be irreconcilable differences in an increasingly polarized society may have arisen through a tipping dynamic that might just as easily have tipped the other way but for the luck of the draw among early movers. Paradoxically, the depth of the social fissure points to the shallowness of disagreements between idiosyncratic tribal combatants whose vitriolic hostility is substantively unwarranted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lunch Break</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/lbreak_1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/lbreak_1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Lunch Break</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/lbreak_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/lbreak_2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>On the Individual Roots of Polarization: Combining Experiments and Modeling</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/sobkowicz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/sobkowicz/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pptxpresentation-sobkowiczpptx">&lt;a href="Presentation-Sobkowicz.pptx">Presentation Slides (PPTX)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most of the sociophysical and Agent Based models of opinion dynamics attempting to describe polarization focus on social interactions. The internal mechanisms of the individual opinion changes are usually significantly simplified. One of the reasons for such simplification is that the actual mechanisms are not very well understood in social psychology. They depend heavily on the contexts, the individual mental and emotional state, communication media and multiple, often conflicting forces.The presentation is based on [1], in which we have set out to study two possible mechanisms influencing political polarization at an individual level. The first is the in-group praise, motivated by the desire to be accepted and recognized group members. The second is the out-group derogation, focusing not on the virtues of one&amp;rsquo;s own group, but on the deficiencies and errors of the opposition. These two mechanisms were studied experimentally and compared to the effects of evidence-based argumentation. The experiments were accompanied by a simple ABM model, in a rather unique process where both approaches augmented and developed each other. We shall discuss the potential use of the results in future ABM models that combine both the individual and social dynamics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reconstructing signed relations from interaction data</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/andres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/andres/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pdfpresentation-andrespdf">&lt;a href="Presentation-Andres.pdf">Presentation Slides (PDF)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Positive and negative relations play an essential role in human behaviour and shape our communities.
Polarization in the internal structure of these communities strongly affects their functioning.
Imagine a community where two groups of individuals have positive relations within but negative relations across the groups.
While such a polarized setting is stable according to structural balance theory, it may hinder constructive dialogue, foster division, and impede collective problem-solving.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stable Signed Networks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/buechel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/buechel/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While standard social networks suppress negative ties, signed networks capture them by coding relations as +1 if positive, ‚àí1 if negative, and 0 if neutral. The economics literature on social networks has always had a particular focus on strategic network formation, but signed networks have been largely ignored. Hence, there is the fundamental question: How do signed networks form among strategic agents?
We address this question by studying how agents strategically form and dissolve positive and negative ties. In our framework agents change their ties, while anticipating the costs and benefits the network means. We extend the notion of pairwise stability to signed networks requiring that deviations to add a positive link or to delete a negative link must be bilateral, while deviations to delete a positive link or to establish a negative link can be unilateral. By analytical derivations and by computational methods, we characterize which networks are stable, and hence likely to emerge, and how they differ from the efficient, i.e., welfare-maximizing, networks. This enables us to show how incentives shape the evolution of signed networks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Structural balance in complex network: Observation, Emergence and Implications</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/vaccario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/vaccario/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pdfpresentation-vaccariopdf">&lt;a href="Presentation-Vaccario.pdf">Presentation Slides (PDF)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since its first conceptualization in psychology, the theory of Structural balance was extended to economics, ecology and social science.
Trespassing disciplinary boundaries, one of its first simple network formulations posits that triangles in signed networks should have an even number of negative links.
This very simple statement has two significant consequences.
First, it strongly affects our expectations about the macroscopic &lt;strong>structure&lt;/strong> and functioning of an analyzed system.
Second, it allows us to define specific &lt;strong>dynamics&lt;/strong> at the microscopic level, i.e., different rules for describing the evolution of signed relations between system elements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The fragility of opinion formation in a complex world</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/medo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/medo/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pdfpresentation-medopdf">&lt;a href="Presentation-Medo.pdf">Presentation Slides (PDF)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>How does the complexity of the world around us affect the
reliability of our opinions? Motivated by this question, we
discuss a simple model in which an observer gradually forms
opinions about a world composed of subjects interconnected
by a signed network of mutual trust and distrust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We show that when the underlying signed network is not balanced, the opinion formation process is highly fragile. An individual who initially trusts a few credible information sources, for example, likely ends up trusting many deceptive information sources. The introduced mathematical framework allows us to ask further questions such as how to improve the reliability of the formed opinions, why is there a phase transition in opinion formation, and how is this related to group formation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Under-representation of nonhierarchical triads in structural balance model</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/gorski/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/gorski/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pdfpresentation-gorskipdf">&lt;a href="Presentation-Gorski.pdf">Presentation Slides (PDF)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>We introduce an agent-based model integrating structural
balance and status, which are prominent theories of signed
link formation process. For complete networks, our analytics
matches simulations showing continuous or discontinuous
phase transition between unbalanced and structurally
balanced paradise states. We identify nonhierarchical triads
for which principles of status theory are broken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Extending
our analysis to large online and small face-to-face
networks, we observe that nonhierarchical triads tend to be
under-represented. We reproduce these deviations in our
simulations by adjusting, among others, the parameter
related to the competition between balance and
status. Relating obtained levels of competition with the
face-to-face dataset&amp;rsquo;s characteristics revealed that
networks with a higher prevalence of strong relations favor
balance, while those with a greater prosociality of agents
exhibit higher under-representations, indicating the larger
influence of status theory.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unpacking Polarization: Antagonism and Alignment in Signed Networks of Online Interaction</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/fraxanet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/fraxanet/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slides-pdfpresentation-fraxanetpdf">&lt;a href="Presentation-Fraxanet.pdf">Presentation Slides (PDF)&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Political conflict is an essential element of democratic systems, but can also threaten
their existence if it becomes too intense. This happens particularly when most polit-
ical issues become aligned along the same major fault line, splitting society into two
antagonistic camps. In the 20th century, major fault lines were formed by structural
conflicts, like owners vs workers, center vs periphery, etc. But these classical cleav-
ages have since lost their explanatory power. Instead of theorizing new cleavages,
we present the FAULTANA (FAULT-line Alignment Network Analysis) pipeline, a
computational method to uncover major fault lines in data of signed online interac-
tions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome and Introductory Remarks</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/schweitzer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/talks/2024_workshop_may/schweitzer/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="presentation-slidesschweitzer-openinghtmlbr">&lt;a href="./Schweitzer-Opening.html">Presentation Slides&lt;/a>&lt;br>&lt;/h3>
