<dd> 
  Agent-based modeling is a powerful methodology to describe the
  occurence of complex behavior in biological systems. The interaction of
  a large number of individuals (agents) may for example lead to the
  emergence of new forms of collective motion. In this paper, we
  investigate a particle-based approach to the coherent motion of a swarm
  with parabolic (i.e. harmonic) interactions between the agents.  It
  is based on generalized Langevin equations for the particle agents, which
  take into account (i) energetic conditions for active motion, (ii)
  linear attractive forces between each two agents. The complex
  collective motion observed can be explained as the result of these
  different influences: the active motion of the agents, which is
  driven by the energy-take up, would eventually lead to a spatial
  dispersion of the swarm, while the mutual interaction of the agents
  results in a tendency of spatial concentration.  In addition to
  particle-based computer simulations, we also provide a mathematical
  framework for investigating the collective dynamics.
