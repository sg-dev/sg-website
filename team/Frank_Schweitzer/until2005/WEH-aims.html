<font face="Times" size="+1">

The progress in the field of complex systems has recently lead to
considerable advances in the understanding of non-equilibrium
phenomena in (self-)driven many-particle systems. 

This has also
initiated a lot of activities in analyzing, modelling and simulating
``living'' systems with methods from statistical physics. 

<p>
The upcoming interdisciplinary workshop is focussing on applications
of <i>physical</i> paradigms to the <i>quantitative</i> description of
<i>social</i> and <i>economic</i> processes.


<p>

Basically, the conference concentrates on two main problems: 
<ol>
<li> the
analysis of economic data, in order to detect scaling laws,  
correlations, and other characteristic interdependencies;
<li> the investigation of microscopic models which mimic economic
systems based on non-linear interactions of a large number of
elements.
</ol>


  Hence, the topics relevant to the conference include:

<ul>
<li> time series analysis of economic data,
<li> microscopic modelling of financial markets,
<li> stochastic models of  socio-economic  interactions,
<li> evolution and chaos in economic systems,
<li> statistical dynamics of decision processes.
</ul>

The particular emphasis on <i>dynamic micro-models</i> intends to
provide insights into economic interactions, which may eventually
explain the complex dynamics in the data observed.

The international workshop on "Economic Dynamics from the Physics
Point of View" pursues the following aims:

<ul>
<li> to give an overview of the application potential of physical methods
  to economic subjects,
<li> to stimulate fruitful discussions among physicists and experts in the
  socio-economic sciences,
<li> to further the international activities and cooperation in the field
  of "econophysics",
<li> to interest advanced physics students for relevant, interdisciplinary
  applications of physics.
</ul>
