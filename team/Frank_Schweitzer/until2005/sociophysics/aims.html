 <i>SocioPhysics</i> has become an attractive field of research over the past
 years, despite some controversies about its scientific eligibility and potential use for
 the understanding of social phenomena. 

 <p>
This international conference tends to reflect these discussions: It brings
together scientists from various disciplines, such as physics, sociology,
informatics, demography, philosophy, political sciences, economics. They will
jointly discuss whether and to what extent physical models and tools can be
reasonably used to enhance quantitative methods and computer simulations in the
social sciences. 

<p>Ideally, this interdisciplinary dialog will result in a mutual enhancement:
Social scientists may learn about the latest development in applying physical
methods to the life and social sciences, physicists and other natural
scientists may increase their awareness of problems, methods, and needs in the
social sciences.
