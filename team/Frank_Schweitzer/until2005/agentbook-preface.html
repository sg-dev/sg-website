Preface

<P>
The emergence of complex behavior in a system consisting of interacting
elements
is among the most fascinating phenomena of our world.  Examples can be
found in almost every field of today's scientific interest, ranging from
coherent pattern formation in physical and chemical systems,
to the motion of swarms of animals in biology
and the behavior of social groups.
The question of how the system properties on the macroscopic level depend
on the microscopic interactions, is one of the major challenges in
complex systems and, despite a number of different attempts, by now
far from being solved.

<P>
In order to gain insight into the interplay between microscopic
interactions and macroscopic features, it is important
to find a level of description that on the one hand considers specific
features of the system and is suitable to reflect the origination of new
qualities, but on the other hand is not flooded with microscopic details.
In this respect, <I>agent models</I> have become a very promising tool
mainly for 
<I>simulating</I> complex systems. 
A commonly accepted <I>theory</I> of agent
systems that also allows analytical investigations
is however still pending because of the diversity of the various
models invented for particular applications. It will be a
multi-disciplinary challenge to improve this situation, in which also
statistical physics needs to play its part, both by contributing concepts
and formal methods.

<P>
The present book wants to contribute to this development. Firstly, we
introduce a particular class of agent models denoted as <I>Brownian
  agents</I> and show its applicability to a variety of problems ranging
from physico-chemistry to biology to economy and the social sciences.  As
we will demonstrate, the Brownian agent approach provides a stable and
efficient method for <I>computer simulations</I> of large ensembles of
agents.  Secondly, we do not just want to present simulation results, but
also want to use the methods of statistical physics to analyze the
dynamics and the properties of systems with large numbers of Brownian
agents, this way contributing pieces for a formal approach to
<I>multi-agent systems</I>.

<P>
Similar to Brownian particles, <I>Brownian agents</I> are subject to both
deterministic and stochastic influences, which will allow us to derive a
generalized Langevin dynamics for their activities. Different from
physical particles, however, Brownian agents have individual 
degrees of freedom that allow them to respond differently to external
signals, to interact with other agents, to change their environment or to
perform active motion. Because all kind of activities need energy, an
important internal degree of freedom is the agent's energy depot. 
In this book, we will extensively investigate the influence of the
internal energy depot on the active, self-driven motion of the agents
that in this respect are denoted as <I>active particles</I>. But also
other activities, such as the interaction via an adaptive ``landscape''
- a field generated by the agents that feeds back to their further
behavior - will be widely discussed. 

<P>
Because of the many examples from very different application areas, the
book will be of interests not only for <I>physicists</I> interested in
self-driven motion or physico-chemical structure formation, but also for
<I>biologists</I> who want to model the collective behavior of bacteria
or insect societies, or for engineers looking for effective algorithms for
the self-assembling and optimization of networks. Major parts of the book
are also devoted Brownian agent models in <I>social</I>,
<I>urban</I> and <I>economic</I> problems, to inspire scientists from these
fields to apply the concept. Among the examples are models for urban and
economic agglomeration, but also models of human behavior, such as the  
motion of pedestrians or the formation of collective opinions. 
The book will show that within the framework provided by statistical
physics, non-linear dynamics and the theory of stochastic processes, 
a formal description of Brownian multi-agent systems can be achieved,
which also allows to derive critical parameters to be used for the
computer simulations, and to predict the outcome of a collective
dynamics. 

<P>
The investigations presented in this book have been carried out in the
years of 1992 to 2001 mainly at the Institute of Physics at Humboldt
University Berlin in close collaboration with the Sonderforschungsbereich
(SFB) 230 ``Natural Constructions'' (Stuttgart) (1992-1995), further at
the Department of Physics at Emory University, Atlanta, GA (1993) and the
Department of City and Regional Planning at Cornell University, Ithaca,
NY (1997). A new light was shed on the results obtained during these
years, when I started to work at the GMD Institute for Autonomous
Intelligent Systems (now part of the Fraunhofer Society) in Sankt
Augustin in 1999. The challenge to combine concepts from distributed
artificial intelligence and new simulation methods for multi-agent
systems with the approaches of many-particle physics eventually gave this
book a new direction. 

<P>
I want to express my sincere thanks to Werner Ebeling (Berlin)
whose fundamental work on the physics of self-organization and evolution
in complex systems is one of the methodological bases of my
investigations. He was actively involved in developing the ideas of
active Brownian particles. Over the years, he promoted my
interdisciplinary engagement, which could thrive in the broad-minded
scientific atmosphere of his research group.
Further, I am very indebted to Lutz Schimansky-Geier (Berlin).
Many of the ideas about interacting Brownian particles presented in this
book were developed in close collaboration with him. His suggestions and
critical remarks always gave new impulses for improving and extending the
concept. Eventually, I would like to thank Heinz M&#252;hlenbein (Sankt Augustin) for
his enduring support of my work and for very many stimulating discussions
in a superb working atmosphere.

<P>
For collaboration, for discussions, suggestions, critical remarks,
for various forms of encouragement, for invitations and
support, I would like to thank further
