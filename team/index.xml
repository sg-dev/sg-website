During my master thesis I applied inference methods and machine learning techniques to study human perception of facial beauty. Currently, my research interests focus on cascade processes, meaning that I am studying how a local shock, appeared in a system, affects its different parts. By adopting a network perspective I can measure the cascade size and try to identify the possible characteristics of the system that prevent a big cascade size.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/christian_zingg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/christian_zingg/</guid><description>In my research I study the effects that shocks have on the network structure of social systems. To examine structural changes I define and analyze measures that are for example based on entropies. Having a theoretical background yet being interested in real world problems it is very important to me to discuss both theory and applications.
Before starting at the Chair of Systems Design as a PhD I studied applied mathematics at the ETH Zurich.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/christoph_gote/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/christoph_gote/</guid><description>Christoph Gote is a PhD Candidate at the Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Specialising in systems theory and control engineering, he received his MSc in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in 2016. He further holds an MSc in Investment and Wealth Management from Imperial College Business School in London, UK, from 2017. His current research focuses on the analysis of collaboration structures in software development teams.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/frank_schweitzer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/frank_schweitzer/</guid><description>Frank Schweitzer has been Full Professor for Systems Design at ETH Zurich since 2004. He is also associated member of the Department of Physics at the ETH Zurich.
Frank Schweitzer received his first Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) in theoretical physics at the age of 26, and his second Ph.D. (Dr. phil.) in philosophy of science at the age of 29, he further earned a habilitation/Venia Legendi in Physics. In his professional career, he worked for different research institutions (Max-Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Dresden, Fraunhofer Institute for Autonomous Intelligent Systems, Sankt Augustin) and universities (Humboldt University Berlin, Cornell University Ithaca NY, Emory University, Atlanta GA).</description></item><item><title/><link>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/georges_andreas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/georges_andreas/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/giacomo_vaccario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/giacomo_vaccario/</guid><description>My main interests are in the quantification of knowledge and of its exchange in academia and in R&amp;amp;D activities.
In particular, I concentrate on two specific classes of problems. The first class of problems is related to the question of how knowledge artifacts are linked to each other, ranked and filtered in repositories. Examples of repositories are patent and scientific publication databases. The second class of problems relates to the question of how knowledge is exchanged and transferred.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/giona_casiraghi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/giona_casiraghi/</guid><description>Interests I am interested in network science, statistical methods focusing on the analysis of complex systems, resilience, data science in general, and snow.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/laurence_brandenberger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/laurence_brandenberger/</guid><description>I study legislative behavior and parliamentary networks. I am particularly interested in the temporal dynamics of political actors working together, for instance looking at how long it takes for a member of parliament to reciprocate a favor by a colleague. Furthermore, I study how political actors change their political positions over time and influence each other.
As a quantitative social scientist, I use Relational Event Models (REMs), Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) and temporal variations thereof (so-called TERGMs or BTERGMs) and conventional regressions for my analyses.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/luca_verginer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/luca_verginer/</guid><description>I am an economist researching through the methods of complex systems, temporal network analysis, machine learning and standard econometrics migration of high skill labour, citation dynamics in patents and papers and spatial diffusion of knowledge.
I am also a core contributor of Pathpy, the open source temporal network analysis library developed here at SG and the DAG Group at the University of Zürich. Work on the exciting and novel field of temporal networks allows me to test these methods on various economic networks (e.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/nadja_taras/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/nadja_taras/</guid><description>Administrative Assistant</description></item><item><title/><link>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/ramona_roller/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www2.sg.ethz.ch/team/ramona_roller/</guid><description>I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Chair of Systems design at ETH Zurich where I work on data-driven models of socio-historical systems. Currently, I focus on a temporal network model of letter correspondences during the European Reformation. I try to understand the underlying communication patterns which gave rise to the spreading of ideas at that time. Specifically challenging in this respect are the sampling bias of the data, as not all historical artifacts are equally likely to survive over time, and capturing the temporal sequence in which historical actions occurred.</description></item></channel></rss>
