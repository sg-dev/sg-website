During my Master&amp;rsquo;s in physics at the ETHZ I encountered the study of complex systems via network representations and agent based models. The fascination for this line of research lead me to pursue a PhD at the Chair of Systems Design.</description></item><item><title>Giuseppe Russo</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/giuseppe_russo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/giuseppe_russo/</guid><description>Interests I am fascinated by interdisciplinary questions in Computational Social Science and Applied NLP. After completing a MSc in Computer Science at ETH, I worked at IBM exploring NLP applications to medical domain. My current interest in based on applying NLP to ideology detection to frame alliances and opinions.</description></item><item><title>Sophia Schlosser</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/sophia-schlosser/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/sophia-schlosser/</guid><description>Prior to joining the chair of Systems Design, Sophia received a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Communications and Political Science from the University of Zürich, and a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in International Affairs from the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin and the Graduate Institute in Geneva. Sophia&amp;rsquo;s research interests focus on political networks, in particular covering political polarization dynamics, the professionalization processes of parliaments, and in general the science-policy nexus.</description></item><item><title>Ambra Amico</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/ambra_amico/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/ambra_amico/</guid><description>I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zurich, where I completed my PhD in 2023 under the guidance of Prof. Frank Schweitzer. With a background in physics, I got fascinated by the field of complex systems and its interface with economics and social sciences. My current research is centred around large-scale supply chains, specifically focusing on the dynamics of distribution systems. I am interested in devising novel strategies to enhance their resilience against disruptions.</description></item><item><title>Christian Zingg</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/christian_zingg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/christian_zingg/</guid><description>My research examines the impact that shocks such as the departure of key individuals have on social systems and their subsequent recovery. I develop and analyse statistical resilience measures that are, for example, based on entropies and which are computationally efficient. This enables me to study the resilience of systems with hundreds of individuals and analyse their evolution over multiple years.
The social systems that I study are primarily teams of Open Source Software developers on online platforms such as GitHub.</description></item><item><title>Christoph Gote</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/christoph_gote/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/christoph_gote/</guid><description>Christoph Gote is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zurich and at the Data Analytics Group at the University of Zurich. His research focuses on the analysis of collaboration structures in software development teams. To this end, he develops tools, such as git2net and gambit, that facilitate the extraction and cleaning of action and interaction data from git repositories. From these actions and interactions, he subsequently derives fine-grained social and technical networks.</description></item><item><title>Luca Verginer</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/luca_verginer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/luca_verginer/</guid><description>I am a Postdoc at che Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zürich and hold a Ph.D. in Economics and Data Science from IMT Lucca.
I am an empirical economist and network scientist focused on the dynamics of pharmaceutical supply chains and the role of patents in pharmaceutical innovation. My research ambitiously spans both economic and social networks, utilizing a diverse methodological toolkit that includes causal inference, advanced econometrics, and state-of-the-art neural network models, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).</description></item><item><title>Ramona Roller</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/ramona_roller/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/ramona_roller/</guid><description>I am a postdoc at the Chair of Systems Design at ETH Zurich, where I study societal transitions and communication networks. I am particular interested in how European society in the 16th century changed as a result of the Reformation, a social movement that overthrew the Catholic Church. For example, I analyse how scholars specialised in their communication roles and why territories adopted Protestantism. A central aim of my research is to understand the driving factors of transitions, accounting for interdependencies and heterogeneities in complex social systems.</description></item><item><title>Giacomo Vaccario</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/giacomo_vaccario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/giacomo_vaccario/</guid><description>Giacomo is a senior researcher at the Chair of Systems Design, ETH Zurich. In this group, he worked as a post-doc and obtained a Doctorate in Science in 2019. Before joining ETH Zurich, he completed the Part III of the Mathematical Tripos from the University of Cambridge and received a Master in Theoretical Physics from Sapienza University of Rome.
Giacomo&amp;rsquo;s research interests lie in understanding the determinants and effects of cooperation in socio-economic systems.</description></item><item><title>Giona Casiraghi</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/giona_casiraghi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/giona_casiraghi/</guid><description>Research Interests I work on two tighly connected topics. How to define and quantify resilience, in complex systems in general and in social organisations in particular. How to model complex systems from the data, to perform a data-driven study of their properties.
Resilience of Social Organisations We aim at an understanding of how different online social organisations withstand and recover from internal and external shocks, and how such a resilience can be improved.</description></item><item><title>Laurence Brandenberger</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/laurence_brandenberger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/laurence_brandenberger/</guid><description>I study legislative politics and political networks. I am particularly interested in the temporal dynamics of political actors working together, for instance looking at how long it takes for a member of parliament to reciprocate a favor by a colleague. Furthermore, I study how political actors change their political positions over time and influence each other.
I am a quantitative social scientist who loves using computational tools (such as NER, ML or word embeddings) to enhance my insights into substantive research questions.</description></item><item><title>Nadja Taras</title><link>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/nadja_taras/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/nadja_taras/</guid><description>Administrative Assistant
